    public appeal. Containing both ales and lagers, the beers of this category are
    not typically complex, and have smooth, accessible flavors. The ales tend to have
    lager-like qualities, or are designed to appeal to mass-market lager drinkers
    as crossover beers. Mass-market beers with a more international appeal or origin
    are described in the International Lager category.
  class: beer
  comments: Designed to appeal to as broad a range of the general public as possible.
    Strong flavors are a fault.
  comparison: A lighter-bodied, lower-alcohol, lower calorie version of an American
    Lager. Less hop character and bitterness than a Leichtbier.
  examples: Bud Light, Coors Light, Keystone Light, Michelob Light, Miller Lite, Old
    Milwaukee Light
  fg_high: 1.008
  fg_low: 0.998
  flavor: Relatively neutral palate with a crisp and dry finish and a low to very
    low grainy or corn-like flavor that might be perceived as sweetness due to the
    low bitterness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels, and can have a floral,
    spicy, or herbal quality (although rarely strong enough to detect). Low to very
    low hop bitterness. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but
    is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may accentuate the crispness
    of the dry finish. Clean lager fermentation character.
  history: Coors briefly made a light lager in the early 1940s. Modern versions were
    first produced by Rheingold in 1967 to appeal to diet-conscious drinkers, but
    only became popular starting in 1973 after Miller Brewing acquired the recipe
    and marketed the beer heavily to sports fans with the "tastes great, less filling"
    campaign. Beers of this genre became the largest sellers in the United States
    in the 1990s.

  comments: Strong flavors are a fault. Often what non-craft beer drinkers expect
    to be served if they order beer in the United States. May be marketed as Pilsner
    beers outside of Europe, but should not be confused with traditional examples.

    than traditional European Pilsners.

  flavor: Relatively neutral palate with a crisp and dry finish and a moderately-low
    to low grainy or corn-like flavor that might be perceived as sweetness due to
    the low bitterness. Hop flavor ranges from none to moderately-low levels, and
    can have a floral, spicy, or herbal quality (although often not strong enough

    slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels
    of carbonation may accentuate the crispness of the dry finish. Clean lager fermentation
    character.
  history: Although German immigrants had brewed traditional Pilsner-inspired lager
    beer in the United States since the mid-late 1800s, the modern American lager
    style was heavily influenced by Prohibition and World War II. Surviving breweries
    consolidated, expanded distribution, and heavily promoted a beer style that was
    appealing to a broad range of the population. Became the dominant beer style for
    many decades, and spawning many international rivals who would develop similarly
    bland products for the mass market supported by heavy advertising.

  comments: Pre-prohibition Cream Ales were slightly stronger, hoppier (including
    some dry hopping) and more bitter (25-30+ IBUs). These versions should be entered
    in the historical category. Most commercial examples are in the 1.050–1.053 OG
    range, and bitterness rarely rises above 20 IBUs.

  flavor: Low to medium-low hop bitterness. Low to moderate maltiness and sweetness,
    varying with gravity and attenuation. Usually well-attenuated. Neither malt nor
    hops dominate the palate. A low to moderate corny flavor is commonly found, as
    is light DMS (optional). Finish can vary from somewhat dry to faintly sweet. Low
    fruity esters are optional. Low to medium-low hop flavor (any variety, but typically
    floral, spicy, or herbal).
  history: A sparkling or present-use ale that existed in the 1800s and survived prohibition.
    An ale version of the American lager style. Produced by ale brewers to compete
    with lager brewers in Canada and the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest states.
    Originally known as sparkling or present use ales, lager strains were (and sometimes
    still are) used by some brewers, but were not historically mixed with ale strains.
    Many examples are kräusened to achieve carbonation. Cold conditioning isn't traditional,
    although modern brewers sometimes use it.

  impression: A clean, well-attenuated, flavorful American "lawnmower" beer. Easily
    drinkable and refreshing, with more character than typical American lagers.
  ingredients: American ingredients most commonly used. A grain bill of six-row malt,
    or a combination of six-row and North American two-row, is common. Adjuncts can
    include up to 20% maize in the mash, and up to 20% glucose or other sugars in
    the boil. Any variety of hops can be used for bittering and finishing.
  mouthfeel: Generally light and crisp, although body can reach medium. Smooth mouthfeel
    with medium to high attenuation; higher attenuation levels can lend a "thirst
    quenching" quality. High carbonation.

  comments: Different variations exist, from an easy-drinking fairly sweet beer to
    a dry, aggressively-hopped beer with a strong wheat flavor. American rye beers
    should be entered in the Alternative Fermentables specialty category.
  comparison: More hop character and less yeast character than German weissbier. Never
    with the banana and clove character of German weissbier. Generally can have the
    same range and balance as Blonde Ales, but with a wheat character as the primary
    malt flavor.

    is usually even, but may be slightly bitter. Low to moderate hop flavor (citrusy,
    spicy, floral, or fruity). Esters can be moderate to none, but should not include
    banana. No clove phenols. May have a slightly crisp finish.
  history: An American craft beer adaptation of the German weissbier style using a
    cleaner yeast and more hops, first widely popularized by Widmer in the mid-1980s.

  impression: Refreshing wheat beers that can display more hop character and less
    yeast character than their German cousins. A clean fermentation character allows
    bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavors to be complemented by hop flavor and bitterness
    rather than yeast qualities.
  ingredients: Clean American ale or lager yeast (German weissbier yeast is inappropriate).
    Large proportion of wheat malt (often 30–50%, which is lower than is typical in
    German weissbiers). American, German, or New World hops are typical.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Medium-high to high carbonation. Slight
    creaminess is optional; wheat beers sometimes have a soft, ‘fluffy' impression.

  category_name: International Lager
  category_notes: International lagers are the premium mass-market lagers produced
    in most countries in the world. Whether developed from American or European styles,
    they all tend to have a fairly uniform character and are heavily marketed. Loosely
    derived from original Pilsner-type lagers, with colored variations having additional
    malt flavors while retaining a broad appeal to most palates. In many countries,
    the styles will be referred to by their local country names. The use of the term
    "international" doesn't mean that any beers are actually labeled as such; it is
    more of a categorization of similar beers produced worldwide.
  class: beer
  comments: International lagers tend to have fewer adjuncts than standard American
    lagers. They may be all-malt, although strong flavors are still a fault. A broad
    category of international mass-market lagers ranging from up-scale American lagers
    to the typical "import" or "green bottle" international beers found in America
    and many export markets. Often confusingly labeled as a "Pilsner." Any skunkiness
    in commercial beers from being lightstruck in a green bottle is a mishandling
    fault, not a characteristic of the style.
  comparison: Generally more bitter and filling than American lager. Less hoppy and
    bitter than a German Pils. Less body, malt flavor, and hop character than a Czech
    Premium Pale Lager. More robust versions can approach a Munich Helles in flavor,
    although with more of an adjunct quality.
  examples: Asahi Super Dry, Birra Moretti, Corona Extra, Devils Backbone Gold Leaf
    Lager, Full Sail Session Premium Lager, Heineken, Red Stripe, Singha
  fg_high: 1.012
  fg_low: 1.008
  flavor: Low to moderate levels of grainy-malt flavor, with a crisp, dry, well-attenuated
    finish. The grain character can be somewhat neutral, or show a light bready-crackery
    quality or up to moderate corny or malty sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none
    to medium levels, and often showing a floral, spicy, or herbal character if detected.
    Hop bitterness at medium-low to medium level. Balance may vary from slightly malty
    to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. Neutral aftertaste with light
    malt and sometimes hop flavors. A light amount of DMS is not a fault.
  history: In the United States, developed as a premium version of the standard American
    lager, with a similar history. Outside the United States, developed either as
    an imitation of American style lagers, or as a more accessible (and often drier
    and less bitter) version of a Pilsner-type beer. Often heavily marketed and exported
    by large industrial or multi-national breweries.

  comments: A wide spectrum of mass-market Amber lagers developed either independently
    in various countries, or describing rather generic amber beers that may have had
    more historical relevance but who eventually changed into an indistinguishable
    product in modern times.

  flavor: Low to moderate malt profile which can vary from dry to grainy-sweet. Low
    to moderate levels of caramel and toasty-bready notes can be evident. Low to medium-low
    corny sweetness is optional, but not a fault. Hop bitterness is low to moderate,
    and hop flavor is low to moderate with a spicy, herbal, or floral character. The
    balance can be fairly malty to nearly even, with the bitterness becoming more
    noticeable but not objectionable. The bitterness level can increase if the malt
    character increases to match. Clean fermentation profile. Finish is moderately
    dry with a moderately malty aftertaste.

  flavor: Low to medium malty sweetness with medium-low to no caramel and/or roasted

    ranges from none to low levels, and is typically floral, spicy, or herbal. Low
    to medium hop bitterness. May have a very light fruitiness. Moderately crisp finish.
    The balance is typically somewhat malty. Burnt or moderately strong roasted malt
    flavors are a defect.
  history: Darker versions of International Pale Lagers often created by the same
    large, industrial breweries and meant to appeal to a broad audience. Often either
    a colored or sweetened adaptation of the standard pale industrial lager, or a
    more broadly accessible (and inexpensive) version of more traditional dark lagers.

  category_name: Czech Lager
  category_notes: Czech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager,
    special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are
    světlé (pale), polotmavé (amber), and tmavé (dark). The gravity classes are výčepní
    (draft, 7–10 °P), ležák (lager, 11–12 °P), and speciální (special, 13 °P+). Pivo
    is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar
    to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different
    gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by
    their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings,
    particularly within the speciální class. The style guidelines combine some of
    these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as
    the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the
    full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly
    found types for judging purposes. Czech lagers in general are differentiated from
    German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully
    attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract
    remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing
    gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and
    mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color
    and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile,
    while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7–10 °C) and for a longer time,
    and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that
    often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant
    buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean
    and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity
    (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally
    made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while
    most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These
    differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes
    Czech lagers.
  class: beer
  comments: The Czech name of the style is světlé výčepní pivo.
  comparison: A lighter-bodied, lower-intensity, refreshing, everyday version of Czech
    Premium Pale Lager.

  flavor: Medium-low to medium bready-rich malt flavor with a rounded, hoppy finish.
    Low to medium-high spicy or herbal hop flavor. Bitterness is prominent but never
    harsh. Flavorful and refreshing. Diacetyl or fruity esters are acceptable at low
    levels, but need not be present and should never be overbearing.
  history: Josef Groll initially brewed two types of beer in 1842–3, a výčepní and
    a ležák, with the smaller beer having twice the production; Evan Rail speculates
    that these were probably 10 °P and 12 °P beers, but that the výčepní could have
    been weaker. This is the most consumed type of beer in the Czech Republic at present.

  impression: A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having
    the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer
    but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.
  ingredients: Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops,
    Czech Pilsner malt, Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively
    soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderate carbonation.

  appearance: Gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear clarity. Dense, long-lasting,

  aroma: Medium to medium-high bready-rich malt and medium-low to medium-high spicy,
    floral, or herbal hop bouquet; though the balance between the malt and hops may
    vary, the interplay is rich and complex. Light diacetyl, or very low fruity hop-derived
    esters are acceptable, but need not be present.

  category_name: Czech Lager
  category_notes: Czech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager,
    special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are
    světlé (pale), polotmavé (amber), and tmavé (dark). The gravity classes are výčepní
    (draft, 7–10 °P), ležák (lager, 11–12 °P), and speciální (special, 13 °P+). Pivo
    is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar
    to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different
    gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by
    their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings,
    particularly within the speciální class. The style guidelines combine some of
    these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as
    the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the
    full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly
    found types for judging purposes. Czech lagers in general are differentiated from
    German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully
    attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract
    remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing
    gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and
    mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color
    and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile,
    while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7–10 °C) and for a longer time,
    and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that
    often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant
    buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean
    and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity
    (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally
    made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while
    most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These
    differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes
    Czech lagers.
  class: beer
  comments: Generally a group of pivo Plzeňského typu, or Pilsner-type beers. This
    style is a combination of the Czech styles světlý ležák (11–12.9 °P) and světlé
    speciální pivo (13–14.9 °P). In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell is called
    a Pilsner, despite how widely adopted this name is worldwide. Kvasnicové ("yeast
    beer") versions are popular in the Czech Republic, and may be either kräusened
    with yeasted wort or given a fresh dose of pure yeast after fermentation. These
    beers are sometimes cloudy, with subtle yeastiness and enhanced hop character.
    Modern examples vary in their malt to hop balance and many are not as hop-forward
    as Pilsner Urquell.
  comparison: More color, malt richness, and body than a German Pils, with a fuller
    finish and a cleaner, softer impression. Stronger than a Czech Pale Lager.
  examples: Bernard Sváteční ležák, Gambrinus Premium, Kout na Šumavě Koutská 12°,
    Pilsner Urquell, Pivovar Jihlava Ježek 11°, Primátor Premium, Únětická 12°
  fg_high: 1.017
  fg_low: 1.013
  flavor: Rich, complex, bready maltiness combined with a pronounced yet soft and
    rounded bitterness and floral and spicy hop flavor. Malt and hop flavors are medium
    to medium-high, and the malt may contain a slight impression of caramel. Bitterness
    is prominent but never harsh. The long finish can be balanced towards hops or
    malt but is never aggressively tilted either way. Light to moderate diacetyl and
    low hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.
  history: Commonly associated with Pilsner Urquell, which was first brewed in 1842
    after construction of a new brewhouse by burghers dissatisfied with the standard
    of beer brewed in Plzeň. Bavarian brewer Josef Groll is credited with first brewing
    the beer.

  impression: Rich, characterful, pale Czech lager, with considerable malt and hop
    character and a long, rounded finish. Complex yet well-balanced and refreshing.
    The malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer, and the bitterness is strong
    but clean and without harshness, which gives a rounded impression that enhances
    drinkability.
  ingredients: Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops,
    Czech malt, Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded
    hop profile despite high hopping rates. The bitterness level of some larger commercial
    examples has dropped in recent years, although not as much as in many contemporary
    German examples.
  mouthfeel: Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation.

  comments: The Czech name of the style is polotmavé pivo, which translates as half
    dark. This style is a combination of the Czech styles polotmavý ležák (11–12.9
    °P) and polotmavé speciální pivo (13–14.9 °P).
  comparison: The style can be similar to a Vienna lager but with Saazer-type hop
    character, or that approaching an English bitter but significantly richer with
    more of a deep caramel character. Large brewery versions are generally similar
    to Czech Premium Pale Lager with slightly darker malt flavors and less hop, while
    smaller breweries often make versions with considerable hop character, malt complexity,
    or residual sweetness.

    13°, Strakonický Dudák Klostermann polotmavý ležák 13°

  flavor: Complex malt flavor is dominant (medium to medium-high), though its nature
    may vary from dry and Maillard product-dominant to caramelly and almost sweet.
    Some examples have a candy-like to graham-cracker malt character. Low to moderate
    spicy hop flavor. Prominent but clean hop bitterness provides a balanced finish.
    Subtle plum or berry esters optional. Low diacetyl optional. No roasted malt flavor.
    Finish may vary from dry and hoppy to relatively sweet.
  history: A Vienna-style lager which has continued to be brewed in the Czech Republic.
    A resurgence of small breweries opening in the Czech Republic has increased the
    number of examples of this style.

  impression: Malt-driven amber Czech lager with hop character that can vary from
    low to quite significant. The malt flavors can vary quite a bit, leading to different
    interpretations ranging from drier, bready, and slightly biscuity to sweeter and
    somewhat caramelly.
  ingredients: Pilsner and caramel malts, but Vienna and Munich malts may also be

  comments: This style is a combination of the Czech styles tmavý ležák (11–12.9 °P)
    and tmavé speciální pivo (13–14.9 °P). More modern examples are drier and have
    higher bitterness while traditional versions often have IBUs in the 18–20 range

    from Munich Dunkel to Schwarzbier, but typically with greater malt richness and
    hop character (aroma, flavor, and/or bitterness).

    Malt flavors such as caramel, toast, nuts, licorice, dried dark fruit, chocolate
    and coffee may also be present, with very low to moderate roast character. Spicy
    hop flavor can be moderately-low to none. Hop bitterness may be moderate to medium-low
    but should be perceptible. Balance can vary from malty to relatively well-balanced
    to gently hop-forward. Low to moderate diacetyl and light plum or berry esters
    may be present.

    profile, with variable levels of hopping providing a range of possible interpretations.
  ingredients: Pilsner and dark caramel malts with the addition of debittered roasted
    malts are most common, but additions of Vienna or Munich malt are also appropriate.
    Low mineral content water, Saazer-type hops, Czech lager yeast. Any fruity esters

    clean lagers, as are most German beers.
  class: beer
  comments: A fully-attenuated Pils malt showcase, Helles is a malt-accentuated beer
    that is not overly sweet, but rather focuses on malt flavor with underlying hop
    bitterness in a supporting role. Export examples can quickly lose some of the
    rich malt character that often suggests sweetness. Helles in Munich tends to be
    lighter in all aspects than those outside the city, which can be more assertive
    with more body, flavor, and hop character.
  comparison: Similar in malt balance and bitterness to Munich Dunkel, but less malty-sweet
    in nature and pale rather than dark. More body and malt presence than a German
    Pils, with less hop character throughout. Similar malt profile as a German Exportbier,
    but with less hops in the balance.

  flavor: Moderately malty start with the suggestion of sweetness, moderate grainy-sweet
    malt flavor with a soft, rounded palate impression, supported by a low to medium-low
    hop bitterness. The finish is soft and dry, not crisp and biting. Low to moderately-low
    spicy, floral or herbal hop flavor. The malt dominates the hops in the palate,
    finish, and aftertaste, but the hops should be noticeable. There should not be
    any residual sweetness, simply the impression of maltiness with restrained bitterness.
    Very fresh examples will seem sweeter due to the fresh, rich malt character that
    can fade with time. Clean fermentation profile.
  history: Created in Munich in 1894 at the Spaten brewery to compete with pale Pilsner-type
    beers. Currently the most popular style in Southern Germany.

  comments: This style represents the modern German beer served at Oktoberfest (although
    it is not solely reserved for Oktoberfest; it can be found at many other ‘fests'),
    and is sometimes called Wiesn ("the meadow" or local name for the Oktoberfest
    festival). We chose to call this style Festbier since by German and EU regulations,
    Oktoberfestbier is a protected appellation for beer produced at large breweries
    within the Munich city limits for consumption at Oktoberfest. Other countries
    are not bound by these rules, so many craft breweries in the US produce beer called
    Oktoberfest, but based on the traditional style described in these guidelines
    as Märzen.
  comparison: Less intense and less richly toasted than a Märzen. More rich-heavy
    in body than a Helles, with more hop flavor and higher alcohol. Less rich in malt
    intensity than a Maibock. The malt complexity is similar to a higher-gravity Czech
    Premium Pale Lager, although without the associated hops.
  examples: Augustiner Oktoberfest, Hacker-Pschorr Superior Festbier, Hofbräu Festbier,
    Löwenbräu Oktoberfestbier, Paulaner Wiesn, Schönramer Gold, Weihenstephaner Festbier
  fg_high: 1.012
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Medium to medium-high malty flavor initially, with a lightly toasty, bread
    dough quality and an impression of soft sweetness. Medium to medium-low bitterness,
    definitely malty in the balance. Well-attenuated and crisp, but not dry. Medium-low
    to medium floral, herbal, or spicy hop flavor. Clean lager fermentation character.
    The taste is mostly of Pils malt, but with slightly toasty hints. The bitterness
    is supportive, but still should yield a malty, flavorful finish.
  history: Since 1990, the majority of beer served at Oktoberfest in Munich has been
    this style. Export beer specifically made for the United States is still mainly
    of the traditional amber style, as are US-produced interpretations. Paulaner first
    created the golden version in the mid-1970s because they thought the traditional
    Oktoberfest was too filling. So they developed a lighter, more drinkable but still
    malty version that they wanted to be "more poundable" (according to the head brewer
    at Paulaner). But the actual type of beer served at Oktoberfest is set by a Munich
    city committee.

    flavors without becoming too heavy or filling.
  ingredients: Majority Pils malt, but with some Vienna and/or Munich malt to increase
    maltiness. Differences in commercial examples are mostly due to different maltsters
    and yeast, not major grist differences.
  mouthfeel: Medium body, with a smooth, somewhat creamy texture. Medium carbonation.

    clean lagers, as are most German beers.
  class: beer
  comments: Also known as Mai Bock, but there is some dispute whether Helles ("pale")
    Bock and Mai ("May") Bock are synonymous. Most agree that they are identical,
    but some believe that Maibock is a "fest" type beer hitting the upper limits of
    hopping and color for the range. Any fruitiness is due to Munich and other specialty
    malts, not yeast-derived esters developed during fermentation. The hops compensate
    for the lower level of Maillard products.
  comparison: Can be thought of as either a pale version of a Dunkles Bock, or a Munich
    Helles brewed to bock strength. While quite malty, this beer typically has less
    dark and rich malt flavors, and can be drier, hoppier, and more bitter than a
    Dunkles Bock. Has more of a rich malt character and more alcohol than a Festbier.

  flavor: Moderately to moderately strong grainy-sweet malt flavor dominates with

    herbal, floral, peppery). Moderate hop bitterness (more so in the balance than
    in other bocks). Clean fermentation profile. Well-attenuated, not cloying, with
    a moderately-dry finish that may taste of both malt and hops.
  history: A fairly recent development in comparison to the other members of the bock
    family. The serving of Maibock is specifically associated with springtime and
    the month of May.

    than in other bocks.
  ingredients: Base of Pils and/or Vienna malt with some Munich malt to add character
    (although much less than in a traditional bock). No non-malt adjuncts. Saazer-type
    hops. Clean lager yeast. Decoction mash is typical, but boiling is less than in
    Dunkles Bock to restrain color development.
  mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation. Smooth and clean
    with no harshness or astringency, despite the increased hop bitterness. A light
    alcohol warming may be present.

    classic German hops. They are generally bottom-fermented or are lagered to provide
    a smooth profile, and are well-attenuated as are most German beers.
  class: beer
  comments: Marketed primarily as a diet-oriented beer with lower carbohydrates, alcohol,
    and calories. Pronounced "LYESHT-beer." May also be known as a Diat Pils or Helles,
    this style is in the schankbier gravity class. Other variations of Leicht class
    beers can be made from Weissbier, Kölsch, and Altbier; those beers are best entered
    in the Mixed-Style Beer category.
  comparison: Like a lower-alcohol, lighter-bodied, slightly less aggressive German
    Pils or Helles.

    and hop flavors, the beer is still interesting to drink.
  ingredients: Similar to a German Pils or Helles, continental Pils malt, German lager
    yeast, Saazer-type hops.
  mouthfeel: Light to very light body. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth, well-attenuated.

  appearance: Very pale gold to light gold. Very clear (authentic commercial versions
    are filtered to a brilliant clarity). Has a delicate white head that may not persist.
  aroma: Low to very low malt aroma, with a grainy-sweet character. A pleasant, subtle
    fruit aroma from fermentation (apple, cherry or pear) is acceptable, but not always
    present. A low floral, spicy or herbal hop aroma is optional but not out of style.
    Some yeast strains may give a slight winy or sulfury character (this characteristic
    is also optional, but not a fault). Overall, the intensity of aromatics is fairly
    subtle but generally balanced, clean, and fresh.

  class: beer
  comments: Characterized in Germany as a top-fermented, lagered beer. Each Köln brewery
    produces a beer of different character, and each interprets the Kölsch Konvention
    slightly differently. Allow for a range of variation within the style when judging.
    Note that drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU specifications
    might suggest. Due to its delicate flavor profile, Kölsch tends to have a relatively
    short shelf-life; older examples and imports can easily show some oxidation defects.
    Served in Köln in a tall, narrow 200ml glass called a Stange.
  comparison: To the untrained taster, easily mistaken for a cream ale or somewhat
    subtle Pils.

  fg_high: 1.011

  flavor: Soft, rounded palate comprised of a delicate flavor balance between soft
    yet attenuated malt, an almost imperceptible fruity sweetness from fermentation,
    and a medium-low to medium bitterness with a delicate dryness and slight crispness
    in the finish (but no harsh aftertaste). The malt tends to be grainy-sweet, possibly
    with a very light bready or honey quality. The hop flavor is variable, and can
    range from low to moderately-high; most are medium-low to medium intensity and
    have a floral, spicy, or herbal character. May have a malty-sweet impression at
    the start, but this is not required. No noticeable residual sweetness. May have
    a slightly winy, minerally, or sulfury accent that accentuates the dryness and
    flavor balance. A slight wheat taste is rare but not a fault. Otherwise, very
    clean.
  history: Cologne, Germany (Köln) has a top-fermenting brewing tradition since the
    Middle Ages, but developed the beer now known as Kölsch in the late 1800s to combat
    encroaching bottom-fermented pale lagers. Kölsch is an appellation protected by
    the Kölsch Konvention (1986), and is restricted to the 20 or so breweries in and
    around Köln. The Konvention simply defines the beer as a "light, highly attenuated,
    hop-accentuated, clear, top-fermenting Vollbier."

  impression: A clean, crisp, delicately-balanced beer usually with a very subtle
    fruit and hop character. Subdued maltiness throughout leads into a pleasantly
    well-attenuated and refreshing finish. Freshness makes a huge difference with
    this beer, as the delicate character can fade quickly with age. Brilliant clarity
    is characteristic.
  ingredients: Traditional German hops (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt or Hersbrucker).
    German Pils or pale malt. Attenuative, clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat malt may
    be used, but this is quite rare in authentic versions. Current commercial practice
    is to ferment warm, cold condition for a short period of time, and serve young.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body (most are medium-light). Medium to medium-high
    carbonation. Smooth and generally crisp and well-attenuated.

  class: beer
  comments: Sometimes known as Dortmunder or Dortmunder Export. Brewed to a slightly
    higher starting gravity than other light lagers, providing a firm malty body and
    underlying maltiness to complement the sulfate-accentuated hop bitterness. The
    term "Export" is a beer strength descriptor under German brewing tradition, and
    is not strictly synonymous with the "Dortmunder" style; beer from other cities
    or regions can be brewed to Export strength, and labeled as such (even if not
    necessarily exported).
  comparison: Less finishing hops and more body than a Pils but more bitter than a
    Helles.

    Gold, Gordon Biersch Golden Export, Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold
  fg_high: 1.015
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Neither grainy-sweet malt nor floral, spicy, or herbal hops dominate, but
    both are in good balance with a touch of malty sweetness, providing a smooth yet
    crisply refreshing beer. Balance continues through the finish and the hop bitterness
    lingers in aftertaste (although some examples may finish slightly sweet). Clean
    fermentation character. Some mineral character might be noted from the water,
    although it usually does not come across as an overt minerally flavor.
  history: The Dortmunder style developed in the Dortmund industrial region in the
    1870s in response to pale Pilsner-type beers, it became very popular after World
    War II but declined in the 1970s. Other Export-class beers developed independently,
    and reflected a slightly stronger version of existing beers. The modern German
    style is typically 12-13 °P.

  category_notes: This category describes German-origin beers that are pale and have
    an even to bitter balance with a mild to moderately strong hoppy character featuring
    classic German hops. They are generally bottom-fermented or are lagered to provide
    a smooth profile, and are well-attenuated as are most German beers.
  class: beer
  comments: Modern examples of Pils tend to become paler in color, drier in finish,
    and more bitter as you move from South to North in Germany, often mirroring the
    increase in sulfate in the water. The Pils found in Bavaria tend to be a bit softer
    in bitterness with more malt flavor and late hop character, yet still with sufficient
    hops and crispness of finish to differentiate itself from a Helles. The use of
    the term ‘Pils' is more common in Germany than ‘Pilsner' to differentiate it from
    the Czech style, and (some say) to show respect.
  comparison: Lighter in body and color, drier, crisper, and more fully attenuated,
    with more of a lingering bitterness, and with higher carbonation than a Czech
    Premium Pale Lager. More hop character, malt flavor, and bitterness than International
    Pale Lagers. More hop character and bitterness with a drier, crisper finish than
    a Munich Helles; the Helles has more malt flavor, but of the same character as
    the Pils.
  examples: König Pilsener, Left Hand Polestar Pils, Paulaner Premium Pils, Schönramer
    Pils, Stoudt Pils, Tröegs Sunshine Pils, Trumer Pils
  fg_high: 1.013
  fg_low: 1.008
  flavor: Medium to high hop bitterness dominates the palate and lingers into the
    aftertaste. Moderate to moderately-low grainy-sweet malt character supports the
    hop bitterness. Low to high floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor. Clean fermentation
    profile. Dry to medium-dry, crisp, well-attenuated finish with a bitter aftertaste
    and light malt flavor. Examples made with water with higher sulfate levels often
    will have a low sulfury flavor that accentuates the dryness and lengthens the
    finish; this is acceptable but not mandatory. Some versions have a soft finish
    with more of a malt flavor, but still with noticeable hop bitterness and flavor,
    with the balance still towards bitterness.
  history: Adapted from Czech Pilsner to suit brewing conditions in Germany, particularly
    water with higher mineral content and domestic hop varieties. First brewed in
    Germany in the early 1870s. Became more popular after WWII as German brewing schools
    emphasized modern techniques. Along with its sister beer, Czech Pilsner, is the
    ancestor of the most widely produced beer styles today. Average IBUs of many well-regarded
    commercial examples have dropped over time.

  class: beer
  comments: Modern domestic German Oktoberfest versions are golden – see the Festbier
    style for this version. Export German versions (to the United States, at least)
    are typically orange-amber in color, have a distinctive toasty malt character,
    and are most often labeled Oktoberfest. American craft versions of Oktoberfest
    are generally based on this style, and most Americans will recognize this beer
    as Oktoberfest. Historic versions of the beer tended to be darker, towards the
    brown color range, but there have been many ‘shades' of Märzen (when the name
    is used as a strength); this style description specifically refers to the stronger
    amber lager version. The modern Festbier can be thought of as a pale Märzen by
    these terms.
  comparison: Not as strong and rich as a Dunkles Bock. More malt depth and richness
    than a Festbier, with a heavier body and slightly less hops. Less hoppy and equally
    malty as a Czech Amber Lager.

  flavor: 'Initial malt flavor often suggests sweetness, but finish is moderately-dry
    to dry. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready, toasty aspect.
    Hop bitterness is moderate, and the hop flavor is low to none (German types: complex,
    floral, herbal, or spicy). Hops provide sufficient balance that the malty palate
    and finish do not seem sweet. The aftertaste is malty, with the same elegant,
    rich malt flavors lingering. Noticeable caramel, biscuit, or roasted flavors are
    inappropriate. Clean lager fermentation profile.'
  history: As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger "March beer" in March and lagered
    in cold caves over the summer. Modern versions trace back to the lager developed
    by Spaten in 1841, contemporaneous to the development of Vienna lager. However,
    the Märzen name is much older than 1841; the early ones were dark brown, and in
    Austria the name implied a strength band (14 °P) rather than a style. The German
    amber lager version (in the Viennese style of the time) was first served at Oktoberfest
    in 1872, a tradition that lasted until 1990 when the golden Festbier was adopted
    as the standard festival beer.

  impression: An elegant, malty German amber lager with a clean, rich, toasty and
    bready malt flavor, restrained bitterness, and a dry finish that encourages another
    drink. The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich
    aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.
  ingredients: Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Munich
    malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the finest quality ingredients, particularly
    the base malts. A decoction mash was traditionally used to develop the rich malt
    profile.
  mouthfeel: Medium body, with a smooth, creamy texture that often suggests a fuller
    mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Fully attenuated, without a sweet or cloying impression.
    May be slightly warming, but the strength should be relatively hidden.

    smoke character can range from subtle to fairly strong, and can seem smoky, woody,
    or bacon-like. The malt character can be low to moderate, and be somewhat rich,
    toasty, or malty-sweet. The malt and smoke components are often inversely proportional
    (i.e., when smoke increases, malt decreases, and vice versa). Hop aroma may be
    very low to none. Clean lager fermentation character.

  class: beer
  comments: Literally "smoke beer" in German. The intensity of smoke character can
    vary widely; not all examples are highly smoked. Allow for variation in the style
    when judging. Other examples of smoked beers are available in Germany based on
    styles such as Dunkles Bock, Weissbier, Dunkel, Schwarzbier, and Helles, including
    examples such as Spezial Lager; these should be entered in the Classic Style Smoked
    Beer category. This description specifically refers to the smoked Märzen version.
  comparison: Like a Märzen with but with a balanced, sweet, smoky aroma and flavor
    and a somewhat darker color.
  examples: Eisenbahn Rauchbier, Kaiserdom Rauchbier, Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen,
    Spezial Rauchbier Märzen Victory Scarlet Fire Rauchbier
  fg_high: 1.016
  fg_low: 1.012
  flavor: Generally follows the aroma profile, with a blend of smoke and malt in varying
    balance and intensity, yet always complementary. Märzen-like qualities should
    be noticeable, particularly a malty, toasty richness, but the beechwood smoke
    flavor can be low to high. At higher levels, the smoke can take on a ham- or bacon-like
    character, which is acceptable as long as it doesn't veer into the greasy range.
    The palate can be somewhat malty, rich, and sweet, yet the finish tends to be
    medium-dry to dry with the smoke character sometimes enhancing the dryness of
    the finish. The aftertaste can reflect both malt richness and smoke flavors, with
    a balanced presentation desirable. Moderate, balanced, hop bitterness. Moderate
    to none hop flavor with spicy, floral, or herbal notes. Clean lager fermentation
    character. Harsh, bitter, burnt, charred, rubbery, sulfury or phenolic smoky characteristics
    are inappropriate.
  history: A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region
    of Bavaria in Germany. Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber
    lager. The smoke character of the malt varies by maltster; some breweries produce
    their own smoked malt (rauchmalz).

  ingredients: German Rauchmalz (beechwood-smoked Vienna-type malt) typically makes

  comments: Decoction mashing and long boiling plays an important part of flavor development,
    as it enhances the caramel and Maillard flavor aspects of the malt. Any fruitiness
    is due to Munich and other specialty malts, not yeast-derived esters developed
    during fermentation.
  comparison: Darker, with a richer malty flavor and less apparent bitterness than
    a Helles Bock. Less alcohol and malty richness than a Doppelbock. Stronger malt
    flavors and higher alcohol than a Märzen. Richer, less attenuated, and less hoppy
    than a Czech Amber Lager.

  flavor: Complex, rich maltiness is dominated by the toasty-rich Maillard products.
    Some caramel notes may be present. Hop bitterness is generally only high enough

    Well-attenuated, not cloying. Clean fermentation profile, although the malt can
    provide a slight dark fruit character. No hop flavor. No roasted or burnt character.
  history: Originated in the Northern German city of Einbeck, which was a brewing
    center and popular exporter in the days of the Hanseatic League (14th to 17th
    century). Recreated in Munich starting in the 17th century. The name "bock" is
    based on a corruption of the name "Einbeck" in the Bavarian dialect, and was thus
    only used after the beer came to Munich. "Bock" also means "Ram" in German, and
    is often used in logos and advertisements.

    but unfortunately are now more like sweet, adjunct-laden Amber/Dark International
    Lagers. Regrettably, many modern examples use adjuncts which lessen the rich malt
    complexity characteristic of the best examples of this style. This style is on
    the watch list to move to the Historical category in future guidelines; that would
    allow the classic style to be described while moving the sweeter modern versions
    to the International Amber or Dark Lager styles.
  comparison: Lighter malt character, slightly less body, and slightly more bitter
    in the balance than a Märzen, yet with many of the same malt-derived flavors.
    The malt character is similar to a Märzen, but less intense and more balanced.
    Lower in alcohol than Märzen or Festbier. Less rich, less malty and less hop-centered
    compared to Czech Amber Lager.

  flavor: Soft, elegant malt complexity is in the forefront, with a firm enough hop
    bitterness to provide a balanced finish. The malt flavor tends towards a rich,
    toasty character, without significant caramel or roast flavors. Fairly dry, crisp
    finish, with both rich malt and hop bitterness present in the aftertaste. Floral,
    spicy hop flavor may be low to none. Clean lager fermentation character.
  history: Developed by Anton Dreher in Vienna in 1841, became popular in the mid-late
    1800s. Now nearly extinct in its area of origin, the style continues in Mexico
    where it was brought by Santiago Graf and other Austrian immigrant brewers in
    the late 1800s. Authentic examples are increasingly hard to find (except perhaps
    in the craft beer industry) as formerly good examples become sweeter and use more
    adjuncts.

  impression: A moderate-strength amber lager with a soft, smooth maltiness and moderate
    bitterness, yet finishing relatively dry. The malt flavor is clean, bready-rich,
    and somewhat toasty, with an elegant impression derived from quality base malts
    and process, not specialty malts and adjuncts.
  ingredients: Vienna malt provides a lightly toasty and complex, Maillard-rich malt
    profile. As with Märzens, only the finest quality malt should be used, along with
    Continental hops (preferably Saazer types or Styrians). Can use some caramel malts
    and/or darker malts to add color and sweetness, but caramel malts shouldn't add
    significant aroma and flavor and dark malts shouldn't provide any roasted character.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, with a gentle creaminess. Moderate carbonation.
    Smooth.

  appearance: The color ranges from light amber to deep copper color, stopping short
    of brown; bronze-orange is most common. Brilliant clarity. Thick, creamy, long-lasting
    off-white head.
  aroma: Clean yet robust and complex aroma of grainy-rich malt and spicy hops with
    restrained (low to medium-low) fruity esters. The malt character reflects German
    base malt varieties, with rich baked bread and nutty-toasty bread crust notes.
    The hop aroma may vary from moderate to low, and can have a peppery, spicy, floral,
    herbal or perfumy character associated with Saazer-type hops.

  category_name: Amber Bitter European Beer
  category_notes: This category groups amber-colored, evenly balanced to bitter balanced
    beers of German or Austrian origin.
  class: beer
  comments: A top-fermented lagered beer, fermented at cool ale temperature (59–68
    °F), often conditioned at bottom-fermentation temperatures (about 50 °F) and then
    lagered at cold temperatures to produce a cleaner, smoother palate than is typical
    for most ales. Zum Uerige is a wonderful beer, but much more aggressively bitter
    and complex than most other German examples. It may be like the Fuller's ESB of
    the strong bitter category – well-known but somewhat of a stylistic outlier. Do
    not judge all Altbiers as if they were Zum Uerige clones; allow for a more balanced
    bitterness in the beer (25–35 IBUs is more typical for most other German examples).
    Stronger sticke and doppelsticke beers should not be entered here.
  comparison: More bitter and malty than international amber lagers. Somewhat similar
    to California Common, both in production technique and finished flavor and color,
    though not in ingredients.
  examples: Bolten Alt, Diebels Alt, Füchschen Alt, Original Schlüssel Alt, Schlösser
    Alt, Schumacher Alt, Uerige Altbier
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.008
  flavor: Assertive hop bitterness well balanced by a sturdy yet clean and crisp malt
    character. The malt presence is moderated by medium-high to high attenuation,
    but considerable rich, complex, and somewhat grainy malt flavors can remain. Some
    fruity esters (especially cherry-like) may survive the lagering period. A long-lasting,
    medium-dry to dry, bittersweet or nutty finish reflects both the hop bitterness
    and malt complexity. Spicy, peppery or floral hop flavor can be moderate to low.
    No roasted malt flavors or harshness. The apparent bitterness level is sometimes
    masked by the malt character; the bitterness can seem as low as moderate if the
    finish is not very dry. Light sulfury or minerally character optional.
  history: The traditional style of beer from Düsseldorf. "Alt" refers to the "old"
    style of brewing (i.e., using top-fermenting yeast) that was common before bottom-fermenting
    lager brewing became popular. Predates the isolation of bottom-fermenting yeast
    strains, though it approximates many characteristics of bottom-fermenting lager
    beers. Many of the classic examples can be found in brewpubs in the Altstadt ("old
    town") section of Düsseldorf.

  impression: A well-balanced, well-attenuated, bitter yet malty, clean, and smooth,
    amber- to copper-colored German beer. The bitterness is balanced by the malt richness,
    but the malt intensity and character can range from moderate to high (the bitterness
    increases with the malt richness).
  ingredients: Grists vary, but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils,
    sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal, chocolate, and/or black malts
    used to adjust color. Occasionally will include some wheat, including roasted
    wheat. Spalt hops are traditional, but other Saazer-type hops can also be used.
    Clean, highly attenuative ale yeast. A step mash or decoction mash program is
    traditional.
  mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Smooth. Medium to medium-high carbonation, although can
    be lower when served from the cask. Astringency low to none. Despite being very
    full of flavor, is light-bodied enough to be consumed as a gravity-fed session
    beer in its home brewpubs in Düsseldorf.

  category_notes: This category groups amber-colored, evenly balanced to bitter balanced
    beers of German or Austrian origin.
  class: beer
  comments: The best examples of Amber Kellerbier are served only on tap at many of
    the small Franconia area breweries (as this is a beer best served fresh and the
    serving style being an important part of the style). Bottled versions are not
    likely to have the freshness, hop character and young beer notes exhibited by
    the draft versions.
  comparison: Most commonly, this style is a young, unfiltered, unpasteurized, hoppier
    version of Munich Helles or Märzen. Fränkische Schweiz versions can edge up to
    dark amber or brown.
  examples: (local) Greif, Eichhorn, Nederkeller, Hebendanz (bottled) Buttenheimer
    Kaiserdom Kellerbier, Kulmbacher Monchshof Kellerbier, Leikeim Kellerbier, Löwenbräu
    Kellerbier, Mahr's Kellerbier, St. Georgen Kellerbier, Tucher Kellerbier Naturtrub
  fg_high: 1.016
  fg_low: 1.012
  flavor: Initial malt flavor may suggest sweetness, but finish is moderately dry
    to dry, and slightly bitter. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes
    a bready-toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately high, and spicy
    or herbal hop flavor is low to moderately high. Balance can be either on the malt
    or hop side, but the finish is not sweet. Noticeable caramel or roasted malt flavors
    are inappropriate. Very low to low diacetyl. Possible very low green apple or
    other yeast-derived notes. Smooth, malty aftertaste.
  history: This was the classic, historical style before it was adapted in other areas.
    This original, older style of Kellerbier would have simply been beer served from
    local taverns that did not lager long enough to drop bright. Many breweries in
    Franconia would use some of this young beer during the summer months, for festivals
    such as the Annafest (est. 1840) in July in Forchheim, where it was traditional
    to drink directly from the lagering vessels.

  impression: A young, unfiltered, and unpasteurized beer that is between a Helles
    and Märzen in color, spicier in the hops with greater attenuation. Interpretations
    range in color and balance, but remain in the drinkable 4.8% ABV neighborhood.
    Balance ranges from the dry, spicy and pale-colored interpretations by St. Georgen
    and Löwenbräu of Buttenheim, to darker and maltier interpretations in the Fränkische
    Schweiz. This style is above all a method of producing simple drinkable beers
    for neighbors out of local ingredients to be served fresh. Balance with a focus
    on drinkability and digestibility is important.
  ingredients: Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Franconian
    pale and color malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the high-quality local
    ingredients, particularly the malts. Spalt or other typically spicy local hops
    are most common. Frugal Franconian brewers rarely used decoction brewing due to
    the cost of energy.
  mouthfeel: Medium body, with a creamy texture and medium carbonation. Fully fermented,
    without a sweet or cloying impression.

  comments: Unfiltered versions from Germany can taste like liquid bread, with a yeasty,
    earthy richness not found in exported filtered examples.
  comparison: Not as intense in maltiness as a bock (and thus more drinkable in quantity).
    Lacking the more roasted flavors (and often hop bitterness) of a schwarzbier.
    Richer, more malt-centric, and less hoppy than a Czech Dark Lager.

    Hacker-Pschorr Alt Munich Dark, Weltenburger Kloster Barock-Dunkel
  fg_high: 1.016
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Dominated by the soft, rich, and complex flavor of darker Munich malts,
    usually with overtones reminiscent of toasted bread crusts, but without a burnt-harsh-grainy
    toastiness. The palate can be moderately malty, although it should not be overwhelming
    or cloyingly sweet. Mild caramel, toast or nuttiness may be present. Very fresh
    examples often have a pleasant malty-chocolate character that isn't roasty or
    sweet. Burnt or bitter flavors from roasted malts are inappropriate, as are pronounced
    caramel flavors from crystal malt. Hop bitterness is moderately low but perceptible,
    with the balance tipped firmly towards maltiness. Hop flavor is low to none; if
    noted, should reflect floral, spicy, or herbal German-type varieties. Aftertaste
    remains malty, although the hop bitterness may become more apparent in the medium-dry
    finish. Clean fermentation profile and lager character.
  history: The classic brown lager style of Munich which developed as a darker, more
    malt-accented beer than other regional lagers. While originating in Munich, the
    style became popular throughout Bavaria (especially Franconia). Franconian versions
    are often darker and more bitter.

  impression: Characterized by depth, richness and complexity typical of darker Munich
    malts with the accompanying Maillard products. Deeply bready-toasty, often with
    chocolate-like flavors in the freshest examples, but never harsh, roasty, or astringent;
    a decidedly malt-balanced beer, yet still easily drinkable.
  ingredients: Grist is traditionally made up of German Munich malt (up to 100% in
    some cases) with the remainder German Pilsner malt. Small amounts of crystal malt
    can add dextrins and color but should not introduce excessive residual sweetness.
    Slight additions of roasted malts (such as Carafa or chocolate) may be used to
    improve color but should not add strong flavors. Traditional German hop varieties
    and German lager yeast strains should be used. Often decoction mashed (up to a
    triple decoction) to enhance the malt flavors and create the depth of color.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body, providing a soft and dextrinous mouthfeel
    without being heavy or cloying. Moderate carbonation. The use of continental Munich-type
    malts should provide a richness, not a harsh or biting astringency.

    malt often apparent. The malt can be clean and neutral or moderately rich and
    bready, and may have a hint of dark caramel. The roast character can be somewhat
    dark chocolate- or coffee-like but should never be burnt. A low spicy, floral,

  comments: Literally means "black beer" in German. While sometimes called a "black
    Pils," the beer is rarely as dark as black or as bitter as a Pils; don't expect
    strongly roasted, porter-like flavors.
  comparison: In comparison with a Munich Dunkel, usually darker in color, drier on
    the palate, lighter in body, and with a noticeable (but not high) roasted malt
    edge to balance the malt base. Should not taste like an American Porter made with
    lager yeast. Drier, less malty, with less hop character than a Czech Dark Lager.

    Köstritzer Schwarzbier, Mönchshof Schwarzbier, Nuezeller Original Badebier
  fg_high: 1.016
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Light to moderate malt flavor, which can have a clean, neutral character
    to a moderately rich, bread-malty quality. Light to moderate roasted malt flavors
    can give a bitter-chocolate palate that lasts into the finish, but which are never
    burnt. Medium-low to medium bitterness, which can last into the finish. Light
    to moderate spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor. Clean lager character. Aftertaste
    tends to dry out slowly and linger, featuring hop bitterness with a complementary
    but subtle roastiness in the background. Some residual sweetness is acceptable
    but not required.
  history: A regional specialty from Thuringia, Saxony and Franconia in Germany. History
    is a bit sketchy, but is suspected of being originally a top-fermented beer. Popularity
    grew after German reunification. Served as the inspiration for black lagers brewed
    in Japan.

  impression: A dark German lager that balances roasted yet smooth malt flavors with
    moderate hop bitterness. The lighter body, dryness, and lack of a harsh, burnt,
    or heavy aftertaste helps make this beer quite drinkable.
  ingredients: German Munich malt and/or Pilsner malts for the base, supplemented
    by a judicious use of roasted malts (such as Carafa types) for the dark color
    and subtle roast flavors. Huskless dark roasted malts can add roast flavors without
    burnt flavors. German hop varieties and clean German lager yeasts are traditional.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.
    Smooth. No harshness or astringency, despite the use of dark, roasted malts.

  class: beer
  comments: Most versions are dark colored and may display the caramelizing and Maillard
    products of decoction mashing, but excellent pale versions also exist. The pale
    versions will not have the same richness and darker malt flavors of the dark versions,
    and may be a bit drier, hoppier and more bitter. While most traditional examples
    are in the lower end of the ranges cited, the style can be considered to have
    no upper limit for gravity, alcohol and bitterness (thus providing a home for
    very strong lagers).
  comparison: A stronger, richer, more full-bodied version of either a Dunkles Bock
    or a Helles Bock. Pale versions will show higher attenuation and less dark fruity
    character than the darker versions.
  examples: Dark Versions –Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel, Ayinger Celebrator, Paulaner

  fg_high: 1.024

  flavor: Very rich and malty. Darker versions will have significant Maillard products
    and often some toasty flavors. Lighter versions will have a strong malt flavor
    with some Maillard products and toasty notes. A very slight chocolate flavor is
    optional in darker versions, but should never be perceived as roasty or burnt.
    Clean lager character. A moderately low malt-derived dark fruit character is optional
    in darker versions. Invariably there will be an impression of alcoholic strength,
    but this should be smooth and warming rather than harsh or burning. Little to
    no hop flavor (more is acceptable in pale versions). Hop bitterness varies from
    moderate to moderately low but always allows malt to dominate the flavor. Most
    versions are fairly malty-sweet, but should have an impression of attenuation.
    The sweetness comes from low hopping, not from incomplete fermentation. Paler
    versions generally have a drier finish.
  history: A Bavarian specialty first brewed in Munich by the monks of St. Francis
    of Paula. Historical versions were less well-attenuated than modern interpretations,
    with consequently higher sweetness and lower alcohol levels (and hence was considered
    "liquid bread" by the monks). The term "doppel (double) bock" was coined by Munich
    consumers. Many commercial doppelbocks have names ending in "-ator," either as
    a tribute to the prototypical Salvator or to take advantage of the beer's popularity.
    Traditionally dark brown in color; paler examples are a more recent development.

  ingredients: Pils and/or Vienna malt for pale versions (with some Munich), Munich
    and Vienna malts for darker ones and occasionally a tiny bit of darker color malts
    (such as Carafa). Saazer-type hops. Clean lager yeast. Decoction mashing is traditional.
  mouthfeel: Medium-full to full body. Moderate to moderately-low carbonation. Very
    smooth without harshness, astringency. A light alcohol warmth may be noted, but

  comments: Extended lagering is often needed post-freezing to smooth the alcohol
    and enhance the malt and alcohol balance. Pronounced "ICE-bock."
  comparison: Eisbocks are not simply stronger doppelbocks; the name refers to the
    process of freezing and concentrating the beer and is not a statement on alcohol;
    some doppelbocks are stronger than Eisbocks. Not as thick, rich, or sweet as a
    Wheatwine.
  examples: Kulmbacher Eisbock
  fg_high: 1.035
  fg_low: 1.02
  flavor: Rich, sweet malt balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The malt can
    have Maillard products, toasty qualities, some caramel, and occasionally a slight
    chocolate flavor. No hop flavor. Hop bitterness just offsets the malt sweetness
    enough to avoid a cloying character. May have significant malt-derived dark fruit
    esters. The alcohol should be smooth, not harsh or hot, and should help the hop
    bitterness balance the strong malt presence. The finish should be of malt and
    alcohol, and can have a certain dryness from the alcohol. It should not be sticky,
    syrupy or cloyingly sweet. Clean lager character.
  history: A traditional Kulmbach specialty brewed by freezing a doppelbock and removing
    the ice to concentrate the flavor and alcohol content (as well as any defects).

  comments: May also be described today as an Imperial Porter, although heavily roasted
    or hopped versions are not appropriate for this style. Most versions are in the
    7–8.5% ABV range. Danish breweries often refer to them as Stouts, which indicates
    their historic lineage from the days when Porter was used as a generic name for
    Porter and Stout.
  comparison: Much less roasted and smoother than an Imperial Stout, typically with
    less alcohol. Lacks the roasty qualities of stouts in general, more taking on
    the roasted-but-not-burnt characteristics of a schwarzbier. Quite fruity compared
    to other porters. Higher alcohol than other porters.

    Sinebrychoff Porter, Zywiec Porter'
  fg_high: 1.024
  fg_low: 1.016
  flavor: As with aroma, has a rich malty sweetness with a complex blend of deep malt,
    dried fruit esters, and alcohol. Has a prominent yet smooth schwarzbier-like roasted
    flavor that stops short of burnt. Mouth-filling and very smooth. Clean lager character.
    Starts sweet but darker malt flavors quickly dominates and persists through finish.
    Just a touch dry with a hint of roast coffee or licorice in the finish. Malt can
    have a caramel, toffee, nutty, molasses and/or licorice complexity. Light hints
    of black currant and dark fruits. Medium-low to medium bitterness from malt and
    hops, just to provide balance. Hop flavor from slightly spicy hops ranges from
    none to medium-low.
  history: Traditional beer from countries bordering the Baltic Sea, developed indigenously
    after higher-gravity export brown or imperial stouts from England were established.
    Historically top-fermented, many breweries adapted the recipes for bottom-fermenting
    yeast along with the rest of their production.

  impression: A Baltic Porter often has the malt flavors reminiscent of an English
    porter and the restrained roast of a schwarzbier, but with a higher OG and alcohol
    content than either. Very complex, with multi-layered malt and dark fruit flavors.
  ingredients: Generally lager yeast (cold fermented if using ale yeast, as is required
    when brewed in Russia). Debittered chocolate or black malt. Munich or Vienna base
    malt. Continental hops (Saazer-type, typically). May contain crystal malts and/or
    adjuncts. Brown or amber malt common in historical recipes.
  mouthfeel: Generally quite full-bodied and smooth, with a well-aged alcohol warmth.
    Medium to medium-high carbonation, making it seem even more mouth-filling. Not
    heavy on the tongue due to carbonation level.

  appearance: Pale straw to gold in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white
    head is characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in an
    unfiltered beer, although the level of haze is somewhat variable.
  aroma: Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (typically banana).
    The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can vary but the
    best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. The hop character
    ranges from low to none. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which might be perceived
    as bready or grainy) may be present but other malt characteristics should not.
    Optional, but acceptable, aromatics can include a light to moderate vanilla character,
    and/or a faint bubblegum aroma. None of these optional characteristics should
    be high or dominant, but often can add to the complexity and balance.

  comments: These are refreshing, fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and
    show a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don't age well
    and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version mit hefe is served with
    suspended yeast; the krystal version is filtered for excellent clarity. The character
    of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less phenolic than that of the weissbier
    mit hefe. May be known as hefeweizen, particularly in the United States.

  flavor: Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity
    of the phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably
    balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla character
    and/or faint bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness and roundness;
    neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready or grainy flavor
    of wheat is complementary, as is a slightly grainy-sweet malt character. Hop flavor
    is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low to moderately low. Well-rounded,
    flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. The perception of sweetness is
    more due to the absence of hop bitterness than actual residual sweetness; a sweet
    or heavy finish would significantly impair drinkability.
  history: While Bavaria has a wheat beer tradition dating back hundreds of years,
    brewing wheat beer used to be a monopoly reserved for Bavarian royalty. Modern
    weissbier dates from 1872 when Schneider began production. However, pale weissbier
    only became popular since the 1960s. It is quite popular today, particularly in
    southern Germany.

  impression: A pale, refreshing German wheat beer with high carbonation, dry finish,
    a fluffy mouthfeel, and a distinctive banana-and-clove yeast character.
  ingredients: By German brewing tradition, at least 50% of the grist must be malted
    wheat, although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is typically Pilsner
    malt. A decoction mash is traditional, although modern brewers typically don't
    follow this practice. Weizen ale yeast produces the typical spicy and fruity character,
    although high fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Suspended yeast may increase
    the perception of body. The texture of wheat imparts the sensation of a fluffy,
    creamy fullness that may progress to a light, spritzy finish aided by high to
    very high carbonation. Always effervescent.

  appearance: Light copper to mahogany brown in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting

    in this traditionally unfiltered style, although the level of haze is somewhat
    variable. Suspended yeast sediment can contribute to cloudiness.

    examples are reasonably balanced. Optionally, a low to moderate vanilla character
    and/or faint bubblegum notes may be present, but should not dominate. Hop aroma

    to moderate wheat aroma (which might be perceived as bready, doughy or grainy)
    may be present and is often accompanied by a caramel, bread crust, or richer malt
    aroma. The malt aroma may moderate the phenols and esters somewhat.

    a deep, rich barley malt character not found in a weissbier. Often known as dunkelweizen,
    particularly in the United States.

    flavor. The malty richness can be low to medium-high, and supports the yeast character.
    A roasted malt character is inappropriate. A spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor
    is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low to low. Well-rounded, flavorful,
    often somewhat malty palate with a relatively dry finish.
  history: Bavaria has a wheat beer brewing traditional hundreds of years old, but
    the brewing right was reserved for Bavarian royalty until the late 1700s. Old-fashioned
    Bavarian wheat beer was often dark, as were most beer of the day. Pale weissbier
    started to become popular in the 1960s, but traditional dark wheat beer remained
    somewhat of an old person's drink.

    drinking.
  ingredients: By German brewing tradition, at least 50% of the grist must be malted
    wheat, although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is usually Munich,
    Vienna, or dark or caramel wheat malts, or Pilsner malt with color malt. A decoction
    mash is traditional, but infrequently used today. Weizen ale yeasts produce the
    typical spicy and fruity character, although extreme fermentation temperatures
    can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium-full body. The texture of wheat as well as yeast
    in suspension imparts the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress
    to a lighter finish, aided by moderate to high carbonation. Effervescent.

  appearance: Pale and dark versions exist, with pale versions being light gold to
    light amber, and dark versions being dark amber to dark ruby-brown in color. A
    very thick, moussy, long-lasting white to off-white (pale versions) or light tan
    (dark versions) head is characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs
    clarity in this traditionally unfiltered style, although the level of haze is
    somewhat variable. Suspended yeast sediment can contribute to the cloudiness.
  aroma: Medium-high to high malty-rich character with a significant bready-grainy
    wheat component. Paler versions will have a bready-toasty malty richness, while
    darker versions will have a deeper, richer malt presence with significant Maillard
    products. The malt component is similar to a helles bock for pale versions (grainy-sweet-rich,
    lightly toasted) or a dunkles bock for dark versions (bready-malty-rich, highly
    toasted, optional caramel). The yeast contributes a typical weizen character of
    banana and spice (clove, vanilla), which can be medium-low to medium-high. Darker
    versions can have some dark fruit aroma (plums, prunes, grapes, raisins), particularly
    as they age. A low to moderate alcohol aroma is acceptable, but shouldn't be hot
    or solventy. No hop aroma. The malt, yeast, and alcohol intertwine to produce
    a complex, inviting, prominent bouquet.

  comments: A Weissbier brewed to bock or doppelbock strength. Schneider also produces
    an Eisbock version. Pale and dark versions exist, although dark are more common.
    Pale versions have less rich malt complexity and often more hops, as with doppelbocks.
    Lightly oxidized Maillard products can produce some rich, intense flavors and
    aromas that are often seen in aged imported commercial products; fresher versions
    will not have this character. Well-aged examples might also take on a slight sherry-like
    complexity.
  comparison: Stronger and richer than a Weissbier or Dunkles Weissbier, but with
    similar yeast character. More directly comparable to the Doppelbock style, with
    the pale and dark variations. Can vary widely in strength, but most are in the
    bock to doppelbock range.
  examples: Dark –Eisenbahn Weizenbock, Plank Bavarian Dunkler Weizenbock, Penn Weizenbock,
    Schneider Unser Aventinus; Pale –Plank Bavarian Heller Weizenbock, Weihenstephaner

  fg_high: 1.022

  flavor: Similar to the aroma, a medium-high to high malty-rich flavor together with
    a significant bready-grainy wheat flavor. Paler versions will have a bready, toasty,
    grainy-sweet malt richness, while darker versions will have deeper, bready-rich
    or toasted malt flavors with significant Maillard products, optional caramel.
    Low to moderate banana and spice (clove, vanilla) yeast character. Darker versions
    can have some dark fruit flavor (plums, prunes, grapes, raisins), particularly
    as they age. A light chocolate character (but not roast) is optional in darker
    versions. No hop flavor. A low hop bitterness can give a slightly sweet palate
    impression, but the beer typically finishes dry (sometimes enhanced by a light
    alcohol character). The interplay between the malt, yeast, and alcohol adds complexity
    and interest, which is often enhanced with age.
  history: Aventinus, the world's oldest top-fermented wheat doppelbock, was created
    in 1907 at the Schneider Weisse Brauhaus in Munich.

  impression: A strong, malty, fruity, wheat-based ale combining the best malt and
    yeast flavors of a weissbier (pale or dark) with the malty-rich flavor, strength,
    and body of a Dunkles Bock or Doppelbock.
  ingredients: A high percentage of malted wheat is used (by German brewing tradition
    must be at least 50%, although it may contain up to 70%), with the remainder being
    Munich- and/or Vienna-type barley malts in darker versions, and more Pils malt
    in paler versions. Some color malts may be used sparingly. A traditional decoction
    mash can give the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen ale yeasts
    produce the typical spicy and fruity character. Too warm or too cold fermentation
    will cause the phenols and esters to be out of balance and may create off-flavors.
    Hop choice is essentially irrelevant, but German varieties are most traditional.
  mouthfeel: Medium-full to full body. A fluffy or creamy texture is typical, as is
    the mild warming sensation of substantial alcohol content. Moderate to high carbonation.

  category_name: British Bitter
  category_notes: The family of British bitters grew out of English pale ales as a
    draught product in the late 1800s. The use of crystal malts in bitters became
    more widespread after WWI. Traditionally served very fresh under no pressure (gravity
    or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e., "real ale"). Most bottled or
    kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are often higher-alcohol and more highly
    carbonated versions of cask products produced for export, and have a different
    character and balance than their draught counterparts in Britain (often being
    sweeter and less hoppy than the cask versions). These guidelines reflect the "real
    ale" version of the style, not the export formulations of commercial products.  Several
    regional variations of bitter exist, ranging from darker, sweeter versions served
    with nearly no head to brighter, hoppier, paler versions with large foam stands,
    and everything in between. Judges should not over-emphasize the caramel component
    of these styles. Exported bitters can be oxidized, which increases caramel-like
    flavors (as well as more negative flavors). Do not assume that oxidation-derived
    flavors are traditional or required for the style.
  class: beer
  comments: The lowest gravity member of the British Bitter family, typically known
    to consumers simply as "bitter" (although brewers tend to refer to it as Ordinary
    Bitter to distinguish it from other members of the family).
  comparison: Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known
    as golden ales, summer ales, or golden bitters. Emphasis is on the bittering hop
    addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American
    ales.

  flavor: Medium to moderately high bitterness. Moderately low to moderately high

    is typically bready, biscuity, or lightly toasty. Low to moderate caramel or toffee
    flavors are optional. Balance is often decidedly bitter, although the bitterness
    should not completely overpower the malt flavor, esters and hop flavor. Generally
    no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.

  comments: In England today, "ESB" is a Fullers trademark, and no one thinks of it
    as a generic class of beer. It is a unique (but very well-known) beer that has
    a very strong, complex malt profile not found in other examples, often leading
    judges to overly penalize traditional English strong bitters. In America, ESB
    has been co-opted to describe a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for
    the US) British-type ale, and is a popular craft beer style. This may cause some
    judges to think of US brewpub ESBs as representative of this style.
  comparison: More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter,
    as well as more alcohol. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with British strong
    ales, although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. More malt
    flavor (particularly caramel) and esters than an American Pale Ale, with different
    finishing hop character.

  fg_high: 1.016
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Medium to medium-high bitterness with supporting malt flavors evident. The
    malt profile is typically bready, biscuity, nutty, or lightly toasty, and optionally
    has a moderately low to moderate caramel or toffee flavor. Hop flavor moderate
    to moderately high, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, and/or fruity character.
    Hop bitterness and flavor should be noticeable, but should not totally dominate
    malt flavors. Moderately-low to high fruity esters. Optionally may have low amounts
    of alcohol. Medium-dry to dry finish. Generally no diacetyl, although very low
    levels are allowed.
  history: See comments in category introduction. Strong bitters can be seen as a
    higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily "more premium"
    since best bitters are traditionally the brewer's finest product). British pale
    ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer that
    roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling (including
    increasing carbonation levels). While modern British pale ale is considered a
    bottled bitter, historically the styles were different.

    may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a
    critical component of the style. A rather broad style that allows for considerable
    interpretation by the brewer.
  ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt
    for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English finishing
    hops are most traditional, but any hops are fair game; if American hops are used,
    a light touch is required. Characterful British yeast. Burton versions use medium
    to high sulfate water, which can increase the perception of dryness and add a
    minerally or sulfury aroma and flavor.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation, although
    bottled versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth
    but this character should not be too high.

  appearance: Straw to golden in color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate
    white head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.
  aroma: Hop aroma is moderately low to moderately high, and can use any variety of
    hops – floral, herbal, or earthy English hops and citrusy American hops are most
    common. Frequently a single hop varietal will be showcased. Little to no malt
    aroma; no caramel. Medium-low to low fruity aroma from the hops rather than esters.
    Little to no diacetyl.

  class: beer
  comments: Well-hopped, quenching beer with an emphasis on showcasing hops. Served
    colder than traditional bitters, this style was originally positioned as a refreshing
    summer beer, but is now often brewed year-round. Although early on the beers were
    brewed with English hops, increasingly American citrus-flavored hops are used.
    Golden Ales are also called Golden Bitters, Summer Ales, or British Blonde Ales.
    Can be found in cask, keg, and bottle.
  comparison: More similar to an American Pale Ale than anything else, although it
    is often lower in alcohol and usually features British ingredients. Has no caramel
    and fewer esters compared to British bitters and pale ales. Dry as bitters but
    with less malt character to support the hops, giving a different balance. Often
    uses (and features) American hops, more so than most other modern British styles.

  flavor: Medium to medium-high bitterness. Hop flavor is moderate to moderately high
    of any hop variety, although citrus flavors are increasingly common. Medium-low
    to low malt character, generally bready with perhaps a little biscuity flavor.
    Caramel flavors are typically absent. Little to no diacetyl. Hop bitterness and
    flavor should be pronounced. Moderately-low to low esters. Medium-dry to dry finish.
    Bitterness increases with alcohol level, but is always balanced.
  history: Modern golden ales were developed in England to take on strongly-marketed
    lagers. While it is difficult to identify the first, Hop Back's Summer Lightning,
    first brewed in 1986, is thought by many to have got the style off the ground.

  impression: A hop-forward, average-strength to moderately-strong pale bitter. Drinkability
    and a refreshing quality are critical components of the style.
  ingredients: Low-color pale or lager malt acting as a blank canvas for the hop character.
    May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English hops frequently used, although
    citrusy American varietals are becoming more common. Somewhat clean-fermenting
    British yeast.
  mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Low to moderate carbonation on draught, although
    bottled commercial versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight
    alcohol warmth, but this character should not be too high.

  appearance: Deep yellow to light amber in color, often medium gold. Tall, frothy,
    persistent white head with tiny bubbles. Noticeable effervescence due to high
    carbonation. Brilliant clarity if decanted, but typically poured with yeast to
    have a cloudy appearance. Not typically cloudy unless yeast roused during the
    pour.
  aroma: Fairly soft, clean aroma with a balanced mix of esters, hops, malt, and yeast
    – all moderate to low in intensity. The esters are frequently pears and apples,
    possibly with a very light touch of banana (optional). The hops are earthy, herbaceous,
    or might show the characteristic iron-like Pride of Ringwood nose. The malt can
    range from neutral grainy to moderately sweet to lightly bready; no caramel should
    be evident. Very fresh examples can have a lightly yeasty, sulfury nose.

  comments: Coopers has been making their flagship Sparkling Ale since 1862, although
    the formulation has changed over the years. Presently the beer will have brilliant
    clarity if decanted, but publicans often pour most of the beer into a glass then
    swirl the bottle and dump in all the yeast. In some bars, the bottle is rolled
    along the bar! When served on draught, the brewery instructs publicans to invert
    the keg to rouse the yeast. A cloudy appearance for the style seems to be a modern
    consumer preference. Always naturally carbonated, even in the keg. A present-use
    ale, best enjoyed fresh.
  comparison: Superficially similar to English Pale Ales, although much more highly
    carbonated, with less caramel, less late hops, and showcasing the signature yeast
    strain and hop variety. More bitter than IBUs might suggest due to high attenuation,
    low final gravity, and somewhat coarse hops.
  examples: Coopers Original Pale Ale, Coopers Sparkling Ale
  fg_high: 1.006
  fg_low: 1.004
  flavor: Medium to low rounded, grainy to bready malt flavor, initially mild to malty-sweet
    but a medium to medium-high bitterness rises mid-palate to balance the malt. Caramel
    flavors typically absent. Highly attenuated, giving a dry finish with lingering
    bitterness, although the body gives an impression of fullness. Medium to medium-high
    hop flavor, somewhat earthy and possibly herbal, resinous, peppery, or iron-like
    but not floral, lasting into aftertaste. Medium-high to medium-low esters, often
    pears and apples. Banana is optional, but should never dominate. May be lightly
    minerally or sulfury, especially if yeast is present. Should not be bland.
  history: Brewing records show that the majority of Australian beer brewed in the
    19th century was draught XXX (Mild) and porter. Ale in bottle was originally developed
    to compete with imported bottled pale ales from British breweries, such as Bass
    and Wm Younger' Monk. By the early 20th century, bottled pale ale went out of
    fashion and "lighter" lager beers were in vogue. Many Australian Sparkling and
    Pale Ales were labeled as ales, but were actually bottom-fermented lagers with
    very similar grists to the ales that they replaced. Coopers of Adelaide, South
    Australia is the only surviving brewer producing the Sparkling Ale style.

  impression: Smooth and balanced, all components merge together with similar intensities.
    Moderate flavors showcasing Australian ingredients. Large flavor dimension. Very
    drinkable, suited to a hot climate. Relies on yeast character.
  ingredients: Lightly kilned Australian 2-row pale malt, lager varieties may be used.
    Small amounts of crystal malt for color adjustment only. Modern examples use no
    adjuncts, cane sugar for priming only. Historical examples using 45% 2 row, 30%
    higher protein malt (6 row) would use around 25% sugar to dilute the nitrogen
    content. Traditionally used Australian hops, Cluster, and Goldings until replaced
    from mid-1960s by Pride of Ringwood. Highly attenuative Burton-type yeast (Australian-type
    strain typical). Variable water profile, typically with low carbonate and moderate
    sulfate.
  mouthfeel: High to very high carbonation, giving mouth-filling bubbles and a crisp,
    spritzy carbonic bite. Medium to medium-full body, tending to the higher side
    if poured with yeast. Smooth but gassy. Stronger versions may have a light alcohol
    warmth, but lower alcohol versions will not. Very well-attenuated; should not
    have any residual sweetness.

  comments: The attributes of IPA that were important to its arrival in good condition
    in India were that it was very well-attenuated, and heavily hopped. Simply because
    this is how IPA was shipped, doesn't mean that other beers such as Porter weren't
    also sent to India, that IPA was invented to be sent to India, that IPA was more
    heavily hopped than other keeping beers, or that the alcohol level was unusual
    for the time. Many modern examples labeled IPA are quite weak in strength. According
    to CAMRA, "so-called IPAs with strengths of around 3.5% are not true to style."
    English beer historian Martyn Cornell has commented that beers like this are "not
    really distinguishable from an ordinary bitter." So we choose to agree with these
    sources for our guidelines rather than what some modern British breweries are
    calling an IPA; just be aware of these two main types of IPAs in the British market
    today.
  comparison: Generally will have more finish hops and less fruitiness and/or caramel
    than British pale ales and bitters. Has less hop intensity and a more pronounced
    malt flavor than typical American versions.
  examples: Freeminer Trafalgar IPA, Fuller's Bengal Lancer IPA, Meantime India Pale
    Ale, Ridgeway IPA, Summit True Brit IPA, Thornbridge Jaipur, Worthington White
    Shield
  fg_high: 1.018
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Hop flavor is medium to high, with a moderate to assertive hop bitterness.
    The hop flavor should be similar to the aroma (floral, spicy-peppery, citrus-orange,
    and/or slightly grassy). Malt flavor should be medium-low to medium, and be somewhat
    bready, optionally with light to medium-light biscuit-like, toasty, toffee-like
    and/or caramelly aspects. Medium-low to medium fruitiness. Finish is medium-dry
    to very dry, and the bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not
    be harsh. The balance is toward the hops, but the malt should still be noticeable
    in support. If high sulfate water is used, a distinctively minerally, dry finish,
    some sulfur flavor, and a lingering bitterness are usually present. Some clean
    alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions. Oak is inappropriate in this
    style.
  history: Accounts of its origins vary, but most agree that what became later known
    as IPA was pale ale prepared for shipment to India in the late 1700s and early
    1800s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery became well-known as an exporter of IPA
    during the early 1800s, and is the first name frequently mentioned with its popularity.
    As with all English beers with a long history, the popularity and formulation
    of the product changed over time. Burton breweries with their high-sulfate water
    were able to successfully brew IPA and began their domination of this market by
    the 1830s, around the time the name India Pale Ale was first used. Strength and
    popularity declined over time, and the style virtually disappeared in the second
    half of the 20th century. The name was often used to describe pale ales and bitters,
    not anything special (a trend that continues in some modern British examples).
    The style underwent a craft beer rediscovery in the 1980s, and is what is described
    in these guidelines. Modern examples are inspired by classic versions, but shouldn't
    be assumed to have an unbroken lineage with the exact same profile. White Shield
    is probably the example with the longest lineage, tracing to the strong Burton
    IPAs of old and first brewed in 1829.

  impression: A hoppy, moderately-strong, very well-attenuated pale British ale with
    a dry finish and a hoppy aroma and flavor. Classic British ingredients provide
    the best flavor profile.
  ingredients: Pale ale malt. English hops are traditional, particularly as finishing
    hops. Attenuative British ale yeast. Refined sugar may be used in some versions.
    Some versions may show a sulfate character from Burton-type water, but this is
    not essential to the style.
  mouthfeel: Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency,
    although moderate to medium-high carbonation can combine to render an overall
    dry sensation despite a supportive malt presence. A low, smooth alcohol warming
    can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all) versions.

  category_notes: While Dark Mild, Brown Ale, and English Porter may have long and
    storied histories, these guidelines describe the modern versions. They are grouped
    together for judging purposes only since they often have similar flavors and balance,
    not because of any implied common ancestry. The similar characteristics are low
    to moderate strength, dark color, generally malty balance, and British ancestry.
    These styles have no historic relationship to each other; especially, none of
    these styles evolved into any of the others, or was ever a component of another.
    The category name was never used historically to describe this grouping of beers;
    it is our name for the judging category. "Brown Beer" was a distinct and important
    historical product, and is not related to this category name.
  class: beer
  comments: Most are low-gravity session beers around 3.2%, although some versions
    may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export, festivals, seasonal and/or
    special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions
    don't often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are possible. Pale versions
    exist, but these are even more rare than dark milds; these guidelines only describe
    the modern dark version.
  comparison: Some versions may seem like lower-gravity modern English porters. Much
    less sweet than London Brown Ale.

    Black Cat, Rudgate Ruby Mild, Theakston Traditional Mild
  fg_high: 1.013

  flavor: Generally a malty beer, although may have a very wide range of malt- and
    yeast-based flavors (e.g., malty, sweet, caramel, toffee, toast, nutty, chocolate,
    coffee, roast, fruit, licorice, plum, raisin). Can finish sweet to dry. Versions
    with darker malts may have a dry, roasted finish. Low to moderate bitterness,
    enough to provide some balance but not enough to overpower the malt. Fruity esters
    moderate to none. Diacetyl and hop flavor low to none.
  history: Historically, ‘mild' was simply an unaged beer, and could be used as an
    adjective to distinguish between aged or more highly hopped keeping beers. Modern
    milds trace their roots to the weaker X-type ales of the 1800s, although dark
    milds did not appear until the 20th century. In current usage, the term implies
    a lower-strength beer with less hop bitterness than bitters. The guidelines describe
    the modern British version. The term ‘mild' is currently somewhat out of favor
    with consumers, and many breweries no longer use it. Increasingly rare. There
    is no historic connection or relationship between Mild and Porter.

  impression: A dark, low-gravity, malt-focused British session ale readily suited
    to drinking in quantity. Refreshing, yet flavorful, with a wide range of dark
    malt or dark sugar expression.
  ingredients: Pale British base malts (often fairly dextrinous), crystal malt, dark
    malts or dark sugar adjuncts, may also include adjuncts such as flaked maize,
    and may be colored with brewer's caramel. Characterful British ale yeast. Any
    type of hops, since their character is muted and rarely is noticeable.
  mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Generally low to medium-low carbonation. Roast-based
    versions may have a light astringency. Sweeter versions may seem to have a rather
    full mouthfeel for the gravity.

  comments: A wide-ranging category with different interpretations possible, ranging
    from lighter-colored to hoppy to deeper, darker, and caramel-focused; however,
    none of the versions have strongly roasted flavors. A stronger Double Brown Ale
    was more popular in the past, but is very hard to find now. While London Brown
    Ales are marketed using the name Brown Ale, we list those as a different judging
    style due to the significant difference in balance (especially sweetness) and
    alcohol strength; that doesn't mean that they aren't in the same family, though.
  comparison: More malty balance than British Bitters, with more malt flavors from
    darker grains. Stronger than a Dark Mild. Less roast than an English Porter. Stronger
    and much less sweet than London Brown Ale.

  fg_high: 1.013

  flavor: Gentle to moderate malt sweetness, with a light to heavy caramel character
    and a medium to dry finish. Malt may also have a nutty, toasted, biscuity, toffee,
    or light chocolate character. Medium to medium-low bitterness. Malt-hop balance
    ranges from even to malt-focused; hop flavor low to none (floral or earthy qualities).
    Low to moderate fruity esters can be present.
  history: Brown ale has a long history in Great Britain, although several different
    types of products used that name at various times. Modern brown ale is a 20th
    century creation as a bottled product; it is not the same as historical products
    of the same name. A wide range of gravities were brewed, but modern brown ales
    are generally of the stronger (by current UK standards) interpretation. This style
    is based on the modern stronger British brown ales, not historical versions or
    the sweeter London Brown Ale. Predominantly but not exclusively a bottled product
    currently.

    re-creations should be entered in the Historical style category, with an appropriate
    description describing the profile of the beer. Modern craft examples in the UK
    are bigger and hoppier.
  comparison: Differs from an American Porter in that it usually has softer, sweeter
    and more caramelly flavors, lower gravities, and usually less alcohol; the American
    Porter will also typically have more of a hop character. More substance and roast
    than a British Brown Ale. Higher in gravity than a dark mild.

  flavor: Moderate bready, biscuity, and toasty malt flavor includes a mild to moderate
    roastiness (frequently with a chocolate character) and often a significant caramel,
    nutty, and/or toffee character. May have other secondary flavors such as coffee,
    licorice, biscuits or toast in support. Should not have a significant burnt or
    harsh roasted flavor, although small amounts may contribute a bitter chocolate
    complexity. Earthy or floral hop flavor moderate to none. Medium-low to medium
    hop bitterness will vary the balance from slightly malty to slightly bitter. Usually
    fairly well-attenuated, although can be somewhat sweet. Diacetyl moderately-low
    to none. Moderate to low fruity esters.
  history: Originating in London around 300 years ago, porter evolved from earlier
    sweet, Brown Beer popular at the time. Evolved many times with various technological
    and ingredient developments and consumer preferences driving these changes. Became
    a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the 1800s before declining around WWI
    and disappearing in the 1950s. It was re-introduced in the mid-1970s with the
    start of the craft beer era. The name is said to have been derived from its popularity
    with the London working class performing various load-carrying tasks of the day.
    Parent of various regional interpretations over time, and a predecessor to all
    stouts (which were originally called "stout porters"). There is no historic connection
    or relationship between Mild and Porter.

    is not traditional nor is any blatantly ‘butterscotch' character. Most frequently
    a draught product. Smoke character is inappropriate as any found traditionally
    would have come from the peat in the source water. Scottish ales with smoke character
    should be entered as a Classic Style Smoked Beer.

    The malt character can range from dry and grainy to rich, toasty, and caramelly,
    but is never roasty and especially never has a peat smoke character. Traditionally
    the darkest of the Scottish ales, sometimes nearly black but lacking any burnt,
    overtly roasted character.
  ingredients: Originally used Scottish pale malt, grits or flaked maize, and brewers
    caramel for color. Later adapted to use additional ingredients, such as amber
    and brown malts, crystal and wheat malts, and roasted grains or dark sugars for
    color but not for the ‘roasty' flavor. Sugar adjuncts are traditional. Clean or
    slightly fruity yeast. Peat-smoked malt is inauthentic and inappropriate.
  mouthfeel: Medium-low to medium body. Low to moderate carbonation. Can be relatively
    rich and creamy to dry and grainy.

  category_name: Irish Beer
  category_notes: The traditional beers of Ireland contained in this category are
    amber to dark, top-fermented beers of moderate to slightly strong strength, and
    are often widely misunderstood due to differences in export versions, or overly
    focusing on the specific attributes of beer produced by high-volume, well-known
    breweries. Each of the styles in this grouping has a wider range than is commonly
    believed.
  class: beer
  comments: Several variations exist within the style, which causes the guidelines
    to be somewhat broad to accommodate them. Traditional Irish examples are relatively
    low in hops, are grainy with a slight roast dryness in the finish, fairly neutral
    in general. Modern export Irish examples are more caramelly and sweet, and might
    have more esters. American craft versions are often more alcoholic versions of
    the Irish export examples. An emerging Irish craft beer scene is exploring more
    bitter versions of traditional examples. Finally, there are some commercial examples
    that sound Irish but are essentially International Amber Lagers, with sweetish
    palates and little bitterness. These guidelines are written around the traditional
    Irish examples, with slight extensions for export Irish versions and modern craft
    Irish versions.
  comparison: A less-bitter and hoppy Irish equivalent to an English Bitter, with
    a dryish finish due to roasted barley. More attenuated with less caramel flavor
    and body than equivalent-strength Scottish ales.
  examples: Caffrey's Irish Ale, Franciscan Well Rebel Red, Kilkenny Irish Beer, O'Hara's
    Irish Red Ale, Porterhouse Red Ale, Samuel Adams Irish Red, Smithwick's Irish
    Ale
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Moderate to very little caramel malt flavor and sweetness, rarely with a
    light buttered toast or toffee-like quality. The palate often is fairly neutral
    and grainy, or can take on a lightly toasty or biscuity note as it finishes with
    a light taste of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.
    A light earthy or floral hop flavor is optional. Medium to medium-low hop bitterness.
    Medium-dry to dry finish. Clean and smooth. Little to no esters. The balance tends
    to be slightly towards the malt, although light use of roasted grains may increase
    the perception of bitterness slightly.
  history: While Ireland has a long ale brewing heritage, the modern Irish Red Ale
    style is essentially an adaptation or interpretation of the popular English Bitter
    style with less hopping and a bit of roast to add color and dryness. Rediscovered
    as a craft beer style in Ireland, today it is an essential part of most brewery
    lineups, along with a pale ale and a stout.

  impression: An easy-drinking pint, often with subtle flavors. Slightly malty in
    the balance sometimes with an initial soft toffee/caramel sweetness, a slightly
    grainy-biscuity palate, and a touch of roasted dryness in the finish. Some versions
    can emphasize the caramel and sweetness more, while others will favor the grainy
    palate and roasted dryness.
  ingredients: Generally has a bit of roasted barley or black malt to provide reddish
    color and dry roasted finish. Pale base malt. Caramel malts were historically
    imported and more expensive, so not all brewers would use them.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing low levels
    of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel (not required). Moderate carbonation.
    Smooth. Moderately attenuated.

    breweries. Each of the styles in this grouping has a wider range than is commonly
    believed.
  class: beer
  comments: When a brewery offered a stout and a porter, the stout was always the
    stronger beer (it was originally called a "Stout Porter"). Modern versions are
    brewed from a lower OG and no longer necessarily reflect a higher strength than
    porters. This is typically a draught product today; bottled versions are typically
    brewed from a higher OG and are usually called Extra Stouts. Regional differences
    exist in Ireland, similar to variability in English Bitters. Dublin-type stouts
    use roasted barley, are more bitter, and are drier. Cork-type stouts are sweeter,
    less bitter, and have flavors from chocolate and specialty malts. Commercial examples
    of this style are almost always associated with a nitro pour. Do not expect traditional
    bottle-conditioned beers to have the full, creamy texture or very long-lasting
    head traditionally associated with nitrogen dispense.
  comparison: Lower strength than an Irish Extra Stout, but with similar flavors.
    Darker in color (black) than an English porter (brown).

    Irish Stout, O'Hara's Irish Stout, Porterhouse Wrasslers 4X
  fg_high: 1.011
  fg_low: 1.007
  flavor: Moderate roasted grain or malt flavor with a medium to high hop bitterness.
    The finish can be dry and coffee-like to moderately balanced with a touch of caramel
    or malty sweetness. Typically has coffee-like flavors, but also may have a bittersweet
    or unsweetened chocolate character in the palate, lasting into the finish. Balancing
    factors may include some creaminess, medium-low to no fruitiness, and medium to
    no hop flavor (often earthy). The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as
    is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation
    by brewers.
  history: The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London
    porters, but originally reflected a fuller, creamier, more "stout" body and strength.
    Guinness began brewing only porter in 1799, and a "stouter kind of porter" around
    1810. Irish stout diverged from London single stout (or simply porter) in the
    late 1800s, with an emphasis on darker malts. Guinness was among the first breweries
    to use black patent malt for porters and stouts in the 1820s. Guinness began using
    roasted barley after WWII, while London brewers continued to use brown malt. Guinness
    started using flaked barley in the 1950s, also increasing attenuation greatly.
    Guinness Draught was launched as a brand in 1959. Draught cans and bottles were
    developed in the late 1980s and 1990s.

  impression: A black beer with a pronounced roasted flavor, often similar to coffee.
    The balance can range from fairly even to quite bitter, with the more balanced
    versions having a little malty sweetness and the bitter versions being quite dry.
    Draught versions typically are creamy from a nitro pour, but bottled versions
    will not have this dispense-derived character. The roasted flavor can be dry and
    coffee-like to somewhat chocolaty.
  ingredients: Guinness is made using roasted barley, flaked barley, and pale malt,
    but other breweries don't necessarily use roasted barley; they can use chocolate
    or other dark and specialty malts. Whatever combination of malts or grains is
    used, the resulting product should be black. Cork-type stouts are perhaps closer
    to historical London-type stouts in composition with a varied grist not dominated
    by roasted barley.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium-full body, with a somewhat creamy character (particularly
    when served with a nitro pour). Low to moderate carbonation. For the high hop
    bitterness and significant proportion of dark grains present, this beer is remarkably
    smooth. May have a light astringency from the roasted grains, although harshness
    is undesirable.

  class: beer
  comments: Traditionally a bottled product. Consumers expect a stout to always have
    a black color; the flavor intensity from whatever made it black is what consumers
    expect in their beer. Not all breweries make a dry, roasty version typical of
    Guinness; a more balanced and chocolaty version is equally acceptable.
  comparison: Midway between an Irish Stout and a Foreign Extra Stout in strength
    and flavor intensity, although with a similar balance. More body, richness, and
    often malt complexity than an Irish Stout. Black in color, not brown like a porter.
  examples: Guinness Extra Stout (US version), O'Hara's Leann Folláin, Sheaf Stout
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Moderate to moderately high dark-roasted grain or malt flavor with a medium
    to medium-high hop bitterness. The finish can be dry and coffee-like to moderately
    balanced with up to moderate caramel or malty sweetness. Typically has roasted
    coffee-like flavors, but also often has a dark chocolate character in the palate,
    lasting into the finish. Background mocha, biscuit, or vanilla flavors are often
    present and add complexity. Medium-low to no fruitiness. Medium to no hop flavor
    (often earthy or spicy). The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as is the
    roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.
  history: Same roots as Irish stout, but as a stronger product. Guinness Extra Stout
    (Extra Superior Porter, later Double Stout) was first brewed in 1821, and was
    primarily a bottled product. Described by Guinness as a "more full-bodied beer
    with a deeper characteristic roasted bitterness and a rich, mature texture. Of
    all the types of Guinness available today, this is the closest to the porter originally
    brewed by Arthur Guinness." Note that in modern times, Guinness Extra Stout has
    different strengths in different regions; the European version is around 4.2%
    and fits in the Irish Stout style.

  category_notes: This category contains average to strong, bitter to sweet, modern
    British and Irish stouts that originated in England even if some are now more
    widely associated with Ireland. In this case, "British" means the broader British
    Isles not Great Britain.
  class: beer
  comments: Gravities are low in England, higher in exported and US products. Variations
    exist, with the level of residual sweetness, the intensity of the roast character,
    and the balance between the two being the variables most subject to interpretation.
    Some versions in England are very sweet (low attenuation) and also low in ABV
    (Tennent's Sweetheart Stout is 2%), but is an outlier compared to the other examples.
    These guidelines mostly describe the higher gravity, more balanced, export versions
    rather than the low alcohol, very sweet versions that many find quite difficult
    to drink.
  comparison: Much sweeter and less bitter than other stouts (except the stronger
    tropical stout). The roast character is mild, not burnt like other stouts. Somewhat
    similar in balance to oatmeal stouts, albeit with more sweetness.
  examples: Bristol Beer Factory Milk Stout, Left Hand Milk Stout, Lancaster Milk
    Stout, Mackeson's XXX Stout, Marston's Oyster Stout, Samuel Adams Cream Stout
  fg_high: 1.024
  fg_low: 1.012
  flavor: Dark roasted grain/malt impression with coffee and/or chocolate flavors
    dominate the palate. Hop bitterness is moderate. Medium to high sweetness provides
    a counterpoint to the roasted character and hop bitterness, and lasts into the
    finish. Low to moderate fruity esters. Diacetyl low to none. The balance between
    dark grains/malts and sweetness can vary, from quite sweet to moderately dry and
    somewhat roasty.
  history: An English style of stout developed in the early 1900s. Historically known
    as "Milk" or "Cream" stouts, legally this designation is no longer permitted in
    England (but is acceptable elsewhere). The "milk" name is derived from the use
    of lactose, or milk sugar, as a sweetener. Originally marketed as a tonic for
    invalids and nursing mothers.

  ingredients: The sweetness in most Sweet Stouts comes from a lower bitterness level
    than most other stouts and a high percentage of unfermentable dextrins. Lactose,
    an unfermentable sugar, is frequently added to provide additional residual sweetness.
    Base of pale malt, and may use roasted barley, black malt, chocolate malt, crystal
    malt, and adjuncts such as maize or brewing sugars.
  mouthfeel: Medium-full to full-bodied and creamy. Low to moderate carbonation. High
    residual sweetness from unfermented sugars enhances the full-tasting mouthfeel.

  class: beer
  comments: Generally between Sweet and Irish Stouts in sweetness. Variations exist,
    from fairly sweet to quite dry, as well as English and American versions (American
    versions tend to be more hoppy, less sweet, and less fruity). The level of bitterness
    also varies, as does the oatmeal impression. Light use of oatmeal may give a certain
    silkiness of body and richness of flavor, while heavy use of oatmeal can be fairly
    intense in flavor with an almost oily mouthfeel, dryish finish, and slight grainy
    astringency. When judging, allow for differences in interpretation.
  comparison: Most are like a cross between an Irish Extra Stout and a Sweet Stout
    with oatmeal added. Several variations exist, with the sweeter versions more like
    a Sweet Stout with oatmeal instead of lactose, and the drier versions more like
    a more nutty, flavorful Irish Extra Stout. Both tend to emphasize the body and
    mouthfeel.
  examples: Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout, Broughton Scottish Oatmeal
    Stout, Figueroa Mountain Stagecoach Stout, St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, Samuel Smith
    Oatmeal Stout, Young's Oatmeal Stout
  fg_high: 1.018
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Similar to the aroma, with a mild roasted coffee to coffee-and-cream flavor,
    and low to moderately-high fruitiness. Oats and dark roasted grains provide some
    flavor complexity; the oats can add a nutty, grainy or earthy flavor. Dark grains
    can combine with malt sweetness to give the impression of milk chocolate or coffee
    with cream. Medium hop bitterness with the balance toward malt. Medium-sweet to
    medium-dry finish. Diacetyl medium-low to none. Hop flavor medium-low to none,
    typically earthy or floral.
  history: A variant of nourishing or invalid stouts of the late 1800s using oatmeal
    in the grist, similar to the development of sweet stout that used lactose. An
    original Scottish version used a significant amount of oat malt. Later went through
    a shady phase where some English brewers would throw a handful of oats into their
    parti-gyled stouts in order to legally produce a ‘healthy' Oatmeal Stout for marketing
    purposes. Most popular in England between the World Wars, was revived in the craft
    beer era for export, which helped lead to its adoption as a popular modern American
    craft beer style that uses a noticeable (not symbolic) quantity of oats.

  class: beer
  comments: Sweetness levels can vary significantly. Surprisingly refreshing in a
    hot climate.
  comparison: Tastes like a scaled-up sweet stout with higher fruitiness. Similar
    to some Imperial Stouts without the high bitterness, strong/burnt roastiness,
    and late hops, and with lower alcohol. Much more sweet and less hoppy than American
    Stouts. Much sweeter and less bitter than the similar-gravity Export Stouts.

  flavor: Quite sweet with a smooth dark grain flavors, and restrained bitterness.
    Roasted grain and malt character can be moderate to high with a smooth coffee
    or chocolate flavor, although the roast character is moderated in the balance
    by the sweet finish. Moderate to high fruity esters. Can have a sweet, dark rum-like
    quality. Little to no hop flavor. Medium-low to no diacetyl.

  comments: Also known as Foreign Stout, Export Stout, Foreign Export Stout. Historic
    versions (before WWI, at least) had the same OG as domestic Extra Stouts, but
    had a higher ABV because it had a long secondary with Brettanomyces chewing away
    at it. The difference between domestic and foreign versions were the hopping and
    length of maturation.
  comparison: Similar in balance to an Irish Extra Stout, but with more alcohol. Not
    as big or intense as a Russian Imperial Stout. Lacking the strong bitterness and
    high late hops of American Stouts. Similar gravity as Tropical Stout, but with
    a drier finish, higher bitterness, and less esters.

  history: Stronger stouts brewed for the export market today, but with a history
    stretching back to the 18th and 19th centuries when they were more heavily-hopped
    versions of stronger export stouts. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (originally,
    West India Porter, later Foreign Extra Double Stout) was first brewed in 1801
    according to Guinness with "extra hops to give it a distinctive taste and a longer
    shelf life in hot weather, this is brewed [today] in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.
    It [currently] makes up 40% of all the Guinness brewed around the world."

  category_name: Strong British Ale
  category_notes: This category contains the stronger, non-roasty beers of the British
    Isles.
  class: beer
  comments: As an entry category more than a style, the strength and character of
    examples can vary widely. Fits in the style space between normal gravity beers
    (strong bitters, brown ales, English porters) and barleywines. Can include pale
    malty-hoppy beers, English winter warmers, strong dark milds, smaller Burton ales,
    and other unique beers in the general gravity range that don't fit other categories.
    Traditionally a bottle-conditioned product suitable for cellaring.
  comparison: Significant overlap in gravity with old ales, but not having a stale
    or aged character. A wide range of interpretations is possible. Should not be
    as rich or strong as an English Barleywine. Stronger than the stronger everyday
    beers (strong bitters, brown ales, porters). More specialty malt and/or sugar
    character than American Strong Ales.
  examples: Fuller's 1845, Harvey's Elizabethan Ale, J.W. Lees Manchester Star, Samuel
    Smith's Winter Welcome, Young's Winter Warmer
  fg_high: 1.022
  fg_low: 1.015
  flavor: Medium to high malt character often rich with nutty, toffee, or caramel
    flavors. Light chocolate notes are sometimes found in darker beers. May have interesting
    flavor complexity from brewing sugars. Balance is often malty, but may be well
    hopped, which affects the impression of maltiness. Moderate fruity esters are
    common, often with a dark fruit or dried fruit character. The finish may vary
    from medium dry to somewhat sweet. Alcoholic strength should be evident, though
    not overwhelming. Diacetyl low to none, and is generally not desirable.
  history: The heritage varies since this category generally reflects a grouping of
    unrelated minor styles with limited production. Some are historical recreations
    while others are modern. Some directly descend from older styles such as Burton
    ales, while others maintain a historical connection with older beers. As a grouping,
    the notion is relatively modern since beers of this strength category would not
    have been abnormal in past centuries. Do not use this category grouping to infer
    historical relationships between examples; this is almost a modern British specialty
    category where the ‘special' attribute is alcohol level.

  impression: An ale of respectable alcoholic strength, traditionally bottled-conditioned
    and cellared. Can have a wide range of interpretations, but most will have varying
    degrees of malty richness, late hops and bitterness, fruity esters, and alcohol
    warmth. Judges should allow for a significant range in character, as long as the
    beer is within the alcohol strength range and has an interesting ‘British' character,
    it likely fits the style. The malt and adjunct flavors and intensity can vary
    widely, but any combination should result in an agreeable palate experience.
  ingredients: Grists vary, often based on pale malt with caramel and specialty malts.
    Some darker examples suggest that dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt) may
    be appropriate, though sparingly so as to avoid an overly roasted character. Sugary
    adjuncts are common, as are starchy adjuncts (maize, flaked barley, wheat). Finishing
    hops are traditionally English.
  mouthfeel: Medium to full, chewy body. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always
    welcome. Low to moderate carbonation. Smooth texture.

    affected by alcohol and age.
  aroma: Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried-fruit,
    vinous, caramelly, molasses, nutty, toffee, light treacle, and/or other specialty
    malt aromas. Some alcohol and oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those found
    in Sherry or Port. Hop aromas not usually present due to extended aging.
  category_id: '1'
  category_name: Strong British Ale
  category_notes: This category contains the stronger, non-roasty beers of the British
    Isles.
  class: beer
  comments: Strength and character varies widely. The predominant defining quality
    for this style is the impression of age, which can manifest itself in different
    ways (complexity, lactic, Brett, oxidation, leather, vinous qualities, etc.).
    Even if these qualities are otherwise faults, if the resulting character of the
    beer is still pleasantly drinkable and complex, then those characteristics are
    acceptable. In no way should those allowable characteristics be interpreted as
    making an undrinkably off beer as somehow in style. Old Peculier is a fairly unique
    type of beer that is quite different than other Old Ales.
  comparison: Roughly overlapping the British Strong Ale and the lower end of the
    English Barleywine styles, but always having an aged quality. The distinction
    between an Old Ale and a Barleywine is somewhat arbitrary above 7% ABV, and generally
    means having a more significant aged quality (particularly from wood). Barleywines
    tend to develop more of a ‘mature' quality, while Old Ales can show more of the
    barrel qualities (lactic, Brett, vinous, etc.).
  examples: Burton Bridge Olde Expensive, Gale's Prize Old Ale, Greene King Strong
    Suffolk Ale, Marston Owd Roger, Theakston Old Peculier
  fg_high: 1.022
  fg_low: 1.015
  flavor: Medium to high malt character with a luscious malt complexity, often with
    nutty, caramelly and/or molasses-like flavors. Light chocolate or roasted malt
    flavors are optional, but should never be prominent. Balance is often malty-sweet,
    but may be well hopped (the impression of bitterness often depends on amount of
    aging). Moderate to high fruity esters are common, and may take on a dried-fruit
    or vinous character. The finish may vary from dry to somewhat sweet. Extended
    aging may contribute oxidative flavors similar to a fine old Sherry, Port or Madeira.
    Alcoholic strength should be evident, though not overwhelming. Diacetyl low to
    none. Some wood-aged or blended versions may have a lactic or Brettanomyces character;
    but this is optional and should not be too strong. Any acidity or tannin from
    age should be well-integrated and contribute to complexity in the flavor profile,
    not be a dominant experience.
  history: Historically, an aged ale used as stock ales for blending or enjoyed at
    full strength (stale or stock refers to beers that were aged or stored for a significant
    period of time). There are at least two definite types in Britain today, weaker
    draught ones that are similar aged milds of around 4.5%, and stronger ones that
    are often 6-8% or more.

  impression: An ale of moderate to fairly significant alcoholic strength, bigger
    than standard beers, though usually not as strong or rich as barleywine. Often
    tilted towards a maltier balance. "It should be a warming beer of the type that
    is best drunk in half pints by a warm fire on a cold winter's night" – Michael
    Jackson.
  ingredients: Composition varies, although generally similar to British Strong Ales.
    The age character is the biggest driver of the final style profile, which is more
    handling than brewing. May be aged in wood, but should not have a strong wood
    character.
  mouthfeel: Medium to full, chewy body, although older examples may be lower in body
    due to continued attenuation during conditioning. Alcohol warmth is often evident
    and always welcome. Low to moderate carbonation, depending on age and conditioning.
    Light acidity may be present, as well as some tannin if wood-aged; both are optional.

  comments: Also known as "strong Scotch ale." The term "wee heavy" means "small strong"
    and traces to the beer that made the term famous, Fowler's Wee Heavy, a 12 Guinea
    Ale. Historically, the strongest beer from a Scottish ale parti-gyle.

  fg_high: 1.04
  fg_low: 1.018
  flavor: Richly malty with significant caramel (particularly in stronger versions).
    Hints of roasted malt may be present (sometimes perceived as a faint smoke character),
    as may some nutty character, all of which may last into the finish. Peat smoke
    is inappropriate. Hop flavors and bitterness are low to medium-low, so the malt
    presence should dominate the balance. Diacetyl should be low to none. Low to moderate
    esters and alcohol are usually present. Esters may suggest plums, raisins or dried
    fruit. The palate is usually full and sweet, but the finish may be sweet to medium-dry,
    sometimes with a light roasty-grainy note.
  history: More related to historical brews than modern lower-strength Scottish ales,
    these beers have their roots in the strong ales of the 1700s and 1800s, although
    formulations and methods have changed. A premium product, often produced for export.
    Modern versions have lower starting and finishing gravities than their historical
    ancestors.

  impression: Rich, malty, dextrinous, and usually caramel-sweet, these beers can
    give an impression that is suggestive of a dessert. Complex secondary malt and
    alcohol flavors prevent a one-dimensional quality. Strength and maltiness can
    vary, but should not be cloying or syrupy.
  ingredients: Well-modified pale malt, with roasted barley for color. May use some
    crystal malt for color adjustment. Slight smoke character may be present in some
    versions, but derives from roasted grains or from the boil. Peated malt is absolutely
    not traditional.
  mouthfeel: Medium-full to full-bodied, with some versions (but not all) having a
    thick, chewy viscosity. A smooth, alcoholic warmth is usually present and is quite
    welcome since it balances the malty sweetness. Moderate carbonation.

  appearance: Color may range from rich gold to very dark amber or even dark brown
    (often has ruby highlights, but should not be opaque). Low to moderate off-white
    head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze at cooler temperatures,
    but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms. The color may appear
    to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass lens. High alcohol and
    viscosity may be visible in "legs" when beer is swirled in a glass.
  aroma: Very rich and strongly malty, often with a caramel-like aroma in darker versions
    or a light toffee character in paler versions. May have moderate to strong fruitiness,
    often with a dark- or dried-fruit character, particularly in dark versions. The
    hop aroma may range from mild to assertive, and is typically floral, earthy, or
    marmalade-like. Alcohol aromatics may be low to moderate, but are soft and rounded.
    The intensity of these aromatics often subsides with age. The aroma may have a
    rich character including bready, toasty, toffee, and/or molasses notes. Aged versions
    may have a sherry-like quality, possibly vinous or port-like aromatics, and generally
    more muted malt aromas.

  class: beer
  comments: The richest and strongest of modern English Ales. The character of these
    ales can change significantly over time; both young and old versions should be
    appreciated for what they are. The malt profile can vary widely; not all examples
    will have all possible flavors or aromas. Paler varieties won't have the caramel
    and richer malt flavors, nor will they typically have the darker dried fruits
    – don't expect flavors and aromatics that are impossible from a beer of that color.
    Typically written as "Barley Wine" in the UK, and "Barleywine" in the US.
  comparison: Although often a hoppy beer, the English Barleywine places less emphasis
    on hop character than the American Barleywine and features English hops. English
    versions can be darker, maltier, fruitier, and feature richer specialty malt flavors
    than American Barleywines. Has some overlap British Old Ale on the lower end,
    but generally does not have the vinous qualities of age; rather, it tends to display
    the mature, elegant signs of age.

  fg_high: 1.03

  flavor: Strong, intense, complex, multi-layered malt flavors ranging from bready,
    toffee, and biscuity in paler versions through nutty, deep toast, dark caramel,
    and/or molasses in darker versions. Moderate to high malty sweetness on the palate,
    although the finish may be moderately sweet to moderately dry (depending on aging).
    Some oxidative or vinous flavors may be present, and often complex alcohol flavors
    should be evident. Moderate to fairly high fruitiness, often with a dark- or dried-fruit
    character. Hop bitterness may range from just enough for balance to a firm presence;
    balance therefore ranges from malty to somewhat bitter. Pale versions are often
    more bitter, better attenuated, and might show more hop character than darker
    versions; however, all versions are malty in the balance. Low to moderately high
    hop flavor, often floral, earthy, or marmalade-like English varieties.
  history: Strong ales of various formulations have long been brewed in England, and
    were known by several names. The modern barleywine traces back to Bass No. 1,
    which was first called a barleywine in 1872. Barleywines were darker beers until
    Tennant (now Whitbread) first produced Gold Label, a gold-colored barleywine in
    1951. Usually the strongest ale offered by a brewery, and in recent years many
    commercial examples are now vintage-dated and offered as a limited-release winter
    seasonal specialty. The original barleywine style that inspired derivative variations
    in Belgium, the United States, and elsewhere in the world.

    rich in body, with warming alcohol and a pleasant fruity or hoppy interest. When
    aged, it can take on port-like flavors. A wintertime sipper.
  ingredients: High-quality, well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the
    grist, with judicious amounts of caramel malts. Dark malts should be used with
    great restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil. English
    hops such as Northdown, Target, East Kent Goldings and Fuggles are typical. Characterful
    British yeast.
  mouthfeel: Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the
    body may decline with long conditioning). A smooth warmth from aged alcohol should
    be present. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.

  appearance: Light yellow to deep gold in color. Clear to brilliant. Low to medium
    white head with fair to good retention.
  aroma: Light to moderate sweet malty aroma, possibly with a light bready or caramelly
    note. Low to moderate fruitiness is optional, but acceptable. May have a low to
    medium hop aroma, and can reflect almost any hop variety although citrusy, floral,
    fruity, and spicy notes are common.

  comments: Brewpub alternative to standard American lagers, typically offered as
    an entry-level craft beer.
  comparison: Typically has more flavor than American Lagers and Cream Ales. Less
    bitterness than an American Pale Ale.

    Blonde, Victory Summer Love, Widmer Citra Summer Blonde Brew
  fg_high: 1.013

  flavor: Initial soft malty sweetness, but optionally some light character malt flavor
    (e.g., bread, toast, biscuit, wheat) can also be present. Caramel flavors typically
    absent; if present, they are typically low-color caramel notes. Low to medium
    fruity esters optional, but are welcome. Light to moderate hop flavor (any variety),
    but shouldn't be overly aggressive. Medium-low to medium bitterness, but the balance
    is normally towards the malt or even between malt and hops. Finishes medium-dry
    to slightly malty-sweet; impression of sweetness is often an expression of lower
    bitterness than actual residual sweetness.
  history: An American craft beer style produced by many microbreweries and brewpubs,
    particularly those who cannot produce lagers. Regional variations exist (many
    US West Coast brewpub examples are more assertive, like pale ales) but in most
    areas this beer is designed as the least challenging beer in their lineup.

  impression: Easy-drinking, approachable, malt-oriented American craft beer, often
    with interesting fruit, hop, or character malt notes. Well-balanced and clean,
    is a refreshing pint without aggressive flavors.
  ingredients: Generally all malt, but can include up to 25% wheat malt and some sugar
    adjuncts. Any hop variety can be used. Clean American, lightly fruity English,
    or Kölsch yeast. May also be made with lager yeast, or cold-conditioned. Some
    versions may have honey, spices and/or fruit added, although if any of these ingredients
    are stronger than a background flavor they should be entered in those specialty
    categories instead.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth without
    being heavy.

  appearance: Pale golden to light amber. Moderately large white to off-white head
    with good retention. Generally quite clear, although dry-hopped versions may be
    slightly hazy.
  aroma: Moderate to strong hop aroma from American or New World hop varieties with
    a wide range of possible characteristics, including citrus, floral, pine, resinous,
    spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon. None of these specific characteristics
    are required, but hops should be apparent. Low to moderate maltiness supports
    the hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt
    character (bready, toasty, biscuit, caramelly). Fruity esters vary from moderate
    to none. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this character should
    not be excessive.
  category_id: '1'
  category_name: Pale American Ale
  category_notes: This category contains modern American ales of average strength
    and light color that are moderately malty to moderately bitter.
  class: beer
  comments: New hop varieties and usage methods continue to be developed. Judges should
    allow for characteristics of modern hops in this style, as well as classic varieties.
    Becoming more of an international craft style, with local adaptations appearing
    in many countries with an emerging craft beer market. Hopping styles can vary
    from the classic large bitterness addition, to more modern late hop-bursted examples;
    all variations are allowable.
  comparison: Typically lighter in color, cleaner in fermentation by-products, and
    having less caramel flavors than English counterparts. There can be some overlap
    in color between American pale ale and American amber ale. The American pale ale
    will generally be cleaner, have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and
    often more finishing hops. Less bitterness in the balance and alcohol strength
    than an American IPA. More balanced and drinkable, and less intensely hop-focused
    and bitter than session-strength American IPAs (aka Session IPAs).
  examples: Ballast Point Grunion Pale Ale, Firestone Walker Pale 31, Great Lakes
    Burning River, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Stone Pale Ale, Tröegs Pale Ale
  fg_high: 1.015
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Moderate to high hop flavor, typically showing an American or New World
    hop character (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit,
    berry, melon, etc.). Low to moderate clean grainy-malt character supports the
    hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character
    (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late hops and
    bitterness, but the malt presence should be supportive, not distracting. Caramel
    flavors are often absent or fairly restrained (but are acceptable as long as they
    don't clash with the hops). Fruity yeast esters can be moderate to none, although
    many hop varieties are quite fruity. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium
    to dry finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish, but the
    aftertaste should generally be clean and not harsh. Dry hopping (if used) may
    add grassy notes, although this character should not be excessive.
  history: A modern American craft beer era adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting
    indigenous ingredients (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Prior to the explosion
    in popularity of IPAs, was traditionally the most well-known and popular of American
    craft beers.

  impression: A pale, refreshing and hoppy ale, yet with sufficient supporting malt
    to make the beer balanced and drinkable. The clean hop presence can reflect classic
    or modern American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of characteristics.
    An average-strength hop-forward pale American craft beer, generally balanced to
    be more accessible than modern American IPAs.
  ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically North American two-row. American or New World
    hops, with a wide range of allowable characteristics. American or English ale
    yeast (neutral to lightly fruity). Specialty grains may add character and complexity,
    but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains that add
    malt flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or bready notes are often
    used (along with late hops) to differentiate brands.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall smooth
    finish without astringency and harshness.

  comments: Can overlap in color with darker American pale ales, but with a different
    malt flavor and balance. Regional variations exist with some being fairly mainstream
    and others being quite aggressive in hopping. Stronger and more bitter versions
    are now split into the Red IPA style.
  comparison: Darker, more caramelly, more body, and generally less bitter in the
    balance than American Pale Ales. Less alcohol, bitterness, and hop character than
    Red IPAs. Less strength, malt, and hop character than American Strong Ales. Should
    not have a strong chocolate or roast character that might suggest an American
    brown ale (although small amounts are OK).

  flavor: Moderate to high hop flavor with characteristics typical of American or
    New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit,
    stone fruit, berry, or melon). A citrusy hop character is common, but not required.
    Malt flavors are moderate to strong, and usually show an initial malty sweetness
    followed by a moderate caramel flavor (and sometimes other character malts in
    lesser amounts). Malt and hop bitterness are usually balanced and mutually supportive,
    but can vary either way. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Caramel sweetness
    and hop flavor/bitterness can linger somewhat into the medium to full finish.
  history: A modern American craft beer style developed as a variation from American
    Pale Ales. Known simply as Red Ales in some regions, these beers were popularized
    in the hop-loving Northern California and the Pacific Northwest areas before spreading
    nationwide.

  impression: An amber, hoppy, moderate-strength American craft beer with a caramel
    malty flavor. The balance can vary quite a bit, with some versions being fairly
    malty and others being aggressively hoppy. Hoppy and bitter versions should not
    have clashing flavors with the caramel malt profile.
  ingredients: Pale ale malt, typically North American two-row. Medium to dark crystal
    malts. May also contain specialty grains which add additional character and uniqueness.
    American or New World hops, often with citrusy flavors, are common but others
    may also be used.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body. Medium to high carbonation. Overall smooth
    finish without astringency. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth.

    beers of standard strength that can be balanced to bitter.
  class: beer
  comments: This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example,
    although allowing other typical ingredients of the era. Northern Brewer hops are
    not a strict requirement for the style; modern American and New World-type hops
    (especially citrusy ones) are inappropriate, however.
  comparison: Superficially similar to an American Amber Ale, but with specific choices
    for malt and hopping – the hop flavor/aroma is traditional (not modern) American
    hops, malt flavors are more toasty, the hopping is always assertive, and a warm-fermented
    lager yeast is used. Less attenuated, less carbonated and less fruity than Australian
    Sparkling ale.

    Steamworks Steam Engine Lager
  fg_high: 1.014

  flavor: Moderately malty with a pronounced hop bitterness. The malt character is
    usually toasty (not roasted) and caramelly. Low to moderately high hop flavor,
    usually showing rustic, traditional American hop qualities (often woody, rustic,
    minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a lingering hop bitterness and a firm,
    grainy malt flavor. Light fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise clean.
  history: American West Coast original, brewed originally as Steam Beer in the Gold
    Rush era. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally used to
    compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage of the cool
    ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented with a lager yeast,
    but one that was selected to ferment relatively clean beer at warmer temperatures.
    Modern versions are based on Anchor Brewing re-launching the style in the 1970s.

  impression: A lightly fruity beer with firm, grainy maltiness, interesting toasty
    and caramel flavors, and showcasing rustic, traditional American hop characteristics.
  ingredients: Pale ale malt, non-citrusy hops (often Northern Brewer), small amounts
    of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager yeast; however, some strains (often
    with the mention of "California" in the name) work better than others at the warmer
    fermentation temperatures (55 to 60 °F) typically used. Note that some German
    yeast strains produce inappropriate sulfury character.
  mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.

  aroma: Moderate malty-sweet to malty-rich aroma with chocolate, caramel, nutty,
    and/or toasty qualities. Hop aroma is typically low to moderate, of almost any
    variety that complements the malt. Some interpretations of the style may feature
    a stronger hop aroma, an American or New World hop character (citrusy, fruity,
    tropical, etc.), and/or a fresh dry-hopped aroma (all are optional). Fruity esters
    are moderate to very low. The dark malt character is more robust than other brown
    ales, yet stops short of being overly porter-like. The malt and hops are generally
    balanced.

  comments: Most commercial American Browns are not as aggressive as the original
    homebrewed versions, and some modern craft-brewed examples. This style reflects
    the current commercial offerings typically marketed as American Brown Ales rather
    than the hoppier, stronger homebrew versions from the early days of homebrewing.
    These IPA-strength brown ales should be entered in the Specialty IPA as Brown
    IPAs.
  comparison: More chocolate and caramel type flavors than American Pale or Amber
    Ales, typically with less prominent bitterness in the balance. Less bitterness,
    alcohol, and hop character than Brown IPAs. More bitter and generally hoppier
    than English Brown Ales, with a richer malt presence, usually higher alcohol,
    and American/New World hop character.

  flavor: Medium to moderately-high malty-sweet or malty-rich flavor with chocolate,
    caramel, nutty, and/or toasty malt complexity, with medium to medium-high bitterness.
    The medium to medium-dry finish provides an aftertaste having both malt and hops.
    Hop flavor can be light to moderate, and may optionally have a citrusy, fruity,
    or tropical character, although any hop flavor that complements the malt is acceptable.
    Very low to moderate fruity esters.
  history: An American style from the modern craft beer era. Derived from English
    Brown Ales, but with more hops. Pete's Wicked Ale was one of the first and best
    known examples, and inspired many imitations. Popular with homebrewers, where
    very hoppy versions were sometimes called Texas Brown Ales (this is now more appropriately
    a Brown IPA).

  class: beer
  comments: Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation. Dark malt
    intensity and flavor can vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop
    character, and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus
    may seem to have an "American" or "British" character.
  comparison: More bitter and often stronger with more dark malt qualities and dryness
    than English Porters or Pre-Prohibition Porters. Less strong and assertive than
    American Stouts.

    Sierra Nevada Porter
  fg_high: 1.018

  flavor: Moderately strong malt flavor usually features a lightly burnt malt character
    (and sometimes chocolate and/or coffee flavors) with a bit of grainy, dark malt
    dryness in the finish. Overall flavor may finish from dry to medium-sweet. May
    have a sharp character from dark roasted grains, but should not be overly acrid,
    burnt or harsh. Medium to high bitterness, which can be accentuated by the dark
    malt. Hop flavor can vary from low to high with a resiny, earthy, or floral character,
    and balances the dark malt flavors. The dark malt and hops should not clash. Dry-hopped
    versions may have a resiny flavor. Fruity esters moderate to none.
  history: A stronger, more aggressive version of pre-prohibition porters and/or English
    porters developed in the modern craft beer era. Historical versions existed, particularly
    on the US East Coast, some of which are still being produced (see the Historical
    Beer, Pre-Prohibition Porter). This style describes the modern craft version.

  impression: A substantial, malty dark beer with a complex and flavorful dark malt
    character.
  ingredients: May contain several malts, prominently dark malts, which often include
    black malt (chocolate malt is also often used). American hops typically used for
    bittering, but US or UK finishing hops can be used; a clashing citrus quality
    is generally undesirable. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or characterful
    English varieties.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation.
    Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth. May have a slight astringency
    from dark malts, although this character should not be strong.

    bolder roasted malt flavors and hopping than other traditional stouts (except
    Imperial Stouts).
  comparison: Like a hoppy, bitter, strongly roasted Extra or Export Stout. Much more
    roast and body than a Black IPA. Bigger, stronger versions belong in the Russian

  flavor: Moderate to very high roasted malt flavors, often tasting of coffee, roasted
    coffee beans, dark or bittersweet chocolate. May have the flavor of slightly burnt
    coffee grounds, but this character should not be prominent. Low to medium malt
    sweetness, often with rich chocolate or caramel flavors. Medium to high bitterness.
    Low to high hop flavor, generally citrusy or resiny. Low to no esters. Medium
    to dry finish, occasionally with a lightly burnt quality. Alcohol flavors can
    be present up to medium levels, but smooth.
  history: A modern craft beer and homebrew style that applied an aggressive American
    hopping regime to a strong traditional English or Irish stout. The homebrew version
    was previously known as West Coast Stout, which is a common naming scheme for
    a more highly-hopped beer.

  impression: A fairly strong, highly roasted, bitter, hoppy dark stout. Has the body
    and dark flavors typical of stouts with a more aggressive American hop character
    and bitterness.
  ingredients: Common American base malts and yeast. Varied use of dark and roasted
    malts, as well as caramel-type malts. Adjuncts such as oatmeal may be present
    in low quantities. American hop varieties.
  mouthfeel: Medium to full body. Can be somewhat creamy, particularly if a small
    amount of oats have been used to enhance mouthfeel. Can have a bit of roast-derived
    astringency, but this character should not be excessive. Medium-high to high carbonation.

  appearance: Color may range from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque. Deep
    tan to dark brown head. Generally has a well-formed head, although head retention
    may be low to moderate. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs" when
    beer is swirled in a glass.
  aroma: Rich and complex, with variable amounts of roasted grains, maltiness, fruity
    esters, hops, and alcohol. The roasted malt character can take on coffee, dark
    chocolate, or slightly burnt tones and can be light to moderately strong. The
    malt aroma can be subtle to rich and barleywine-like. May optionally show a slight
    specialty malt character (e.g., caramel), but this should only add complexity
    and not dominate. Fruity esters may be low to moderately strong, and may take
    on a complex, dark fruit (e.g., plums, prunes, raisins) character. Hop aroma can
    be very low to quite aggressive, and may contain any hop variety. An alcohol character
    may be present, but shouldn't be sharp, hot, or solventy. Aged versions may have
    a slight vinous or port-like quality, but shouldn't be sour. The balance can vary
    with any of the aroma elements taking center stage. Not all possible aromas described
    need be present; many interpretations are possible. Aging affects the intensity,

  category_name: American Porter And Stout
  category_notes: These beers all evolved from their English namesakes to be wholly
    transformed by American craft brewers. Generally, these styles are bigger, stronger,
    more roast-forward, and more hop-centric than their Anglo cousins. These styles
    are grouped together due to a similar shared history and flavor profile.
  class: beer
  comments: Traditionally an English style, but it is currently much more popular
    and widely available in America where it is a craft beer favorite, not a curiosity.
    Variations exist, with English and American interpretations (predictably, the
    American versions have more bitterness, roasted character, and finishing hops,
    while the English varieties reflect a more complex specialty malt character and
    a more forward ester profile). Not all Imperial Stouts have a clearly ‘English'
    or ‘American' character; anything in between the two variants are allowable as
    well, which is why it is counter-productive to designate a sub-type when entering
    a competition. The wide range of allowable characteristics allow for maximum brewer
    creativity. Judges must be aware of the broad range of the style, and not try
    to judge all examples as clones of a specific commercial beer.
  comparison: Like a black barleywine with every dimension of flavor coming into play.
    More complex, with a broader range of possible flavors than lower-gravity stouts.
  examples: American –Bell's Expedition Stout, Cigar City Marshal Zhukov's Imperial
    Stout, Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout, North Coast Old Rasputin Imperial Stout,
    Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout; English – Courage Imperial Russian Stout,
    Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout, Samuel Smith Imperial Stout

  flavor: Rich, deep, complex and frequently quite intense, with variable amounts
    of roasted malt/grains, maltiness, fruity esters, hop bitterness and flavor, and
    alcohol. Medium to aggressively high bitterness. Medium-low to high hop flavor
    (any variety). Moderate to aggressively high roasted malt/grain flavors can suggest
    bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, and/or strong coffee. A slightly
    burnt grain, burnt currant or tarry character may be evident. Fruity esters may
    be low to intense, and can take on a dark fruit character (raisins, plums, or
    prunes). Malt backbone can be balanced and supportive to rich and barleywine-like,
    and may optionally show some supporting caramel, bready or toasty flavors. The
    palate and finish can vary from relatively dry to moderately sweet, usually with
    some lingering roastiness, hop bitterness and warming character. The balance and
    intensity of flavors can be affected by aging, with some flavors becoming more
    subdued over time and some aged, vinous or port-like qualities developing.
  history: A style with a long, although not necessarily continuous, heritage. Traces
    roots to strong English porters brewed for export in the 1700s, and said to have
    been popular with the Russian Imperial Court. After the Napoleonic wars interrupted
    trade, these beers were increasingly sold in England. The style eventually all
    but died out, until being popularly embraced in the modern craft beer era, both
    in England as a revival and in the United States as a reinterpretation or re-imagination
    by extending the style with American characteristics.

  impression: An intensely-flavored, big, dark ale with a wide range of flavor balances
    and regional interpretations. Roasty-burnt malt with deep dark or dried fruit
    flavors, and a warming, bittersweet finish. Despite the intense flavors, the components
    need to meld together to create a complex, harmonious beer, not a hot mess.
  ingredients: Well-modified pale malt, with generous quantities of roasted malts
    and/or grain. May have a complex grain bill using virtually any variety of malt.
    Any type of hops may be used. American or English ale yeast.
  mouthfeel: Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture
    (although the body may decline with long conditioning). Gentle smooth warmth from
    alcohol should be present and noticeable, but not a primary characteristic; in
    well-conditioned versions, the alcohol can be deceptive. Should not be syrupy
    or under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and
    conditioning.

  aroma: A prominent to intense hop aroma featuring one or more characteristics of
    American or New World hops, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical
    fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Many versions are dry hopped and can have
    an additional fresh hop aroma; this is desirable but not required. Grassiness
    should be minimal, if present. A low to medium-low clean, grainy-malty aroma may
    be found in the background. Fruitiness from yeast may also be detected in some
    versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable. A restrained
    alcohol note may be present, but this character should be minimal at best. Any
    American or New World hop character is acceptable; new hop varieties continue
    to be released and should not constrain this style.

  category_name: IPA
  category_notes: The IPA category is for modern American IPAs and their derivatives.
    This does not imply that English IPAs aren't proper IPAs or that there isn't a
    relationship between them. This is simply a method of grouping similar styles
    for competition purposes. English IPAs are grouped with other English-derived
    beers, and the stronger Double IPA is grouped with stronger American beers. The
    term "IPA" is intentionally not spelled out as "India Pale Ale" since none of
    these beers historically went to India, and many aren't pale. However, the term
    IPA has come to be a balance-defined style in modern craft beer.
  class: beer
  comments: A modern American craft beer interpretation of the historical English
    style, brewed using American ingredients and attitude. The basis for many modern
    variations, including the stronger Double IPA as well as IPAs with various other
    ingredients. Those other IPAs should generally be entered in the Specialty IPA
    style. Oak is inappropriate in this style; if noticeably oaked, enter in wood-aged
    category.
  comparison: Stronger and more highly hopped than an American Pale Ale. Compared
    to an English IPA, has less of the "English" character from malt, hops, and yeast
    (less caramel, bread, and toast; more American/New World hops than English; less
    yeast-derived esters), less body, and often has a more hoppy balance and is slightly
    stronger than most examples. Less alcohol than a Double IPA, but with a similar
    balance.

    Walker Union Jack, Lagunitas IPA, Russian River Blind Pig IPA, Stone IPA
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.008
  flavor: Hop flavor is medium to very high, and should reflect an American or New
    World hop character, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit,
    stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Medium-high to very high hop bitterness. Malt
    flavor should be low to medium-low, and is generally clean and grainy-malty although
    some light caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low yeast-derived fruitiness
    is acceptable but not required. Dry to medium-dry finish; residual sweetness should
    be low to none. The bitterness and hop flavor may linger into the aftertaste but
    should not be harsh. A very light, clean alcohol flavor may be noted in stronger
    versions. May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.
  history: The first modern American craft beer example is generally believed to be
    Anchor Liberty Ale, first brewed in 1975 and using whole Cascade hops; the style
    has pushed beyond that original beer, which now tastes more like an American Pale
    Ale in comparison. American-made IPAs from earlier eras were not unknown (particularly
    the well-regarded Ballantine's IPA, an oak-aged beer using an old English recipe).
    This style is based on the modern craft beer examples.

  impression: A decidedly hoppy and bitter, moderately strong American pale ale, showcasing
    modern American or New World hop varieties. The balance is hop-forward, with a
    clean fermentation profile, dryish finish, and clean, supporting malt allowing
    a creative range of hop character to shine through.
  ingredients: Pale ale or 2-row brewers malt as the base, American or New World hops,
    American or English yeast with a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally all-malt,
    but mashed at lower temperatures for high attenuation. Sugar additions to aid
    attenuation are acceptable. Restrained use of crystal malts, if any, as high amounts
    can lead to a sweet finish and clash with the hop character.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high
    carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Very light, smooth alcohol warming
    not a fault if it does not intrude into overall balance.

    – with something else present to distinguish it from the standard categories.
    Should have good drinkability, regardless of the form. Excessive harshness and
    heaviness are typically faults, as are strong flavor clashes between the hops
    and the other specialty ingredients.

  appearance: Color ranges from golden to light orange-copper; most modern versions
    are fairly pale. Good clarity, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be
    a bit hazy. Moderate-sized, persistent, white to off-white head.
  aroma: A prominent to intense hop aroma that typically showcases American or New
    World hop characteristics (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit,
    stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Most versions are dry hopped and can have an
    additional resinous or grassy aroma, although this is not absolutely required.
    Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either
    from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral
    fermentation character is typical. Some alcohol can usually be noted, but it should
    not have a "hot" character.

  category_name: Strong American Ale
  category_notes: This category includes modern American strong ales with a varying
    balance of malt and hops. The category is defined mostly by alcohol strength and
    a lack of roast.
  class: beer
  comments: A showcase for hops, yet remaining quite drinkable. The adjective "double"
    is arbitrary and simply implies a stronger version of an IPA; "imperial," "extra,"
    "extreme," or any other variety of adjectives would be equally valid, although
    the modern American market seems to have now coalesced around the "double" term.
  comparison: Bigger than either an English or American IPA in both alcohol strength
    and overall hop level (bittering and finish). Less malty, lower body, less rich
    and a greater overall hop intensity than an American Barleywine. Typically not
    as high in gravity/alcohol as a barleywine, since high alcohol and malt tend to
    limit drinkability.

  fg_high: 1.018

  flavor: Hop flavor is strong and complex, and can reflect the characteristics of
    modern American or New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy,
    tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). High to absurdly high hop bitterness.
    Low to medium malt flavor, generally clean and grainy-malty although low levels
    of caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low to medium fruitiness is acceptable
    but not required. A long, lingering bitterness is usually present in the aftertaste
    but should not be harsh. Dry to medium-dry finish; should not finish sweet or
    heavy. A light, clean, smooth alcohol flavor is not a fault. Oak is inappropriate
    in this style. May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this
    character.
  history: An American craft beer innovation first developed in the mid-late 1990s
    reflecting the trend of American craft brewers "pushing the envelope" to satisfy
    the need of hop aficionados for increasingly intense products. Became more mainstream
    and popular throughout the 2000s, and inspired additional IPA creativity.

  impression: An intensely hoppy, fairly strong pale ale without the big, rich, complex
    maltiness and residual sweetness and body of an American barleywine. Strongly
    hopped, but clean, dry, and lacking harshness. Drinkability is an important characteristic;
    this should not be a heavy, sipping beer.
  ingredients: Clean 2-row malt is typical as a base grain; an excessively complex
    grist can be distracting. Crystal-type malts often muddy the hop flavors, and
    are generally considered undesirable in significant quantities. Sugar or other
    highly fermentable adjuncts are often used to increase attenuation, as are lower-temperature
    mash rests. Can use a complex variety of hops, typically American or New World,
    often with cutting-edge profiles providing distinctive differences. Modern hops
    with unusual characteristics are not out of style. American yeast that can give
    a clean or slightly fruity profile.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high
    carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Restrained, smooth alcohol warming
    acceptable.

    (tropical, stone fruit, melon, etc.). Moderate to bold maltiness supports hop
    profile, with medium to dark caramel a common presence, bready or toasty possible
    and background notes of light roast and/or chocolate noticeable in some examples.

  category_notes: This category includes modern American strong ales with a varying
    balance of malt and hops. The category is defined mostly by alcohol strength and
    a lack of roast.
  class: beer
  comments: A fairly broad style that can describe beers labeled in various ways,
    including modern Double/Imperial Red/Amber Ales and other strong, malty-but-hoppy
    beers that aren't quite in the Barleywine class. Diverse enough to include what
    may be viewed as a strong American Amber Ale with room for more interpretations
    of other "Imperial" versions of lower gravity American Ale styles. Many "East
    Coast" type IPAs might fit better in this category if they have considerable crystal
    malt or otherwise more of a malty-sweet finish.
  comparison: Generally not as strong and as rich as an American Barleywine. More
    malt balanced than an American or Double IPA with more American hop intensity
    than an English Strong Ale style would tolerate.
  examples: Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale, Great Lakes Nosferatu, Terrapin Big Hoppy
    Monster, Port Brewing Shark Attack Double Red, Stone Arrogant Bastard,
  fg_high: 1.024
  fg_low: 1.014
  flavor: Medium to high dextrinous malt with a full range of caramel, toffee, dark
    fruit flavors. Low to medium toasty, bready, or Maillard-rich malty flavors are
    optional, and can add complexity. Medium-high to high hop bitterness. The malt
    gives a medium to high sweet impression on the palate, although the finish may
    be slightly sweet to somewhat dry. Moderate to high hop flavor. Low to moderate
    fruity esters. The hop flavors are similar to the aroma (citrusy, resiny, tropical,
    stone fruit, melon, etc.). Alcohol presence may be noticeable, but sharp or solventy
    alcohol flavors are undesirable. Roasted malt flavors are allowable but should
    be a background note; burnt malt flavors are inappropriate. While strongly malty
    on the palate, the finish should seem bitter to bittersweet. Should not be syrupy
    and under-attenuated. The aftertaste typically has malt, hops, and alcohol noticeable.
  history: While modern craft versions were developed as "imperial" strength versions
    of American amber or red ales, the style has much in common with historic American
    stock ales. Strong, malty beers were highly hopped to keep as provision beers
    prior to prohibition. There is no continuous legacy of brewing stock ales in this
    manner, but the resemblance is considerable. Stone Arrogant Bastard was born out
    of a batch of pale ale that was mistakenly made with excess ingredients, thus
    creating what may have been the prototype for the imperial amber/red ale. Great
    Lakes first brewed Nosferatu in the early 1990s and called it a stock ale, although
    they now call it an imperial red ale. So whether by direct historical inspiration
    or by accident, the style developed independently in the craft beer era and has
    subsequently become quite popular.

  impression: A strong, full-flavored American ale that challenges and rewards the
    palate with full malty and hoppy flavors and substantial bitterness. The flavors
    are bold but complementary, and are stronger and richer than average-strength
    pale and amber American ales.
  ingredients: Well-modified pale malt as a base; some character malts would be appropriate,
    medium to dark crystal malts are typical. Citrusy or piney American hops are common,
    although any American or New World varieties can be used in quantity, provided
    they do not clash with the malt character. Generally uses an attenuative American
    yeast.
  mouthfeel: Medium to full body. An alcohol warmth may be present, but not be excessively
    hot. Any astringency present should be attributable to bold hop bitterness and
    should not be objectionable on the palate. Medium-low to medium carbonation.

  appearance: Color may range from light amber to medium copper; may rarely be as
    dark as light brown. Often has ruby highlights. Moderately-low to large off-white
    to light tan head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze
    at cooler temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it
    warms. The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick
    glass lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs" when beer is swirled
    in a glass.
  aroma: Hop character moderate to assertive and often showcases citrusy, fruity,
    or resiny New World varieties (although other varieties, such as floral, earthy
    or spicy English varieties or a blend of varieties, may be used). Rich maltiness,
    with a character that may be sweet, caramelly, bready, or fairly neutral. Low
    to moderately-strong fruity esters and alcohol aromatics. However, the intensity
    of aromatics often subsides with age. Hops tend to be nearly equal to malt in
    the aroma, with alcohol and esters far behind.

  category_name: Strong American Ale
  category_notes: This category includes modern American strong ales with a varying
    balance of malt and hops. The category is defined mostly by alcohol strength and
    a lack of roast.
  class: beer
  comments: Sometimes known as "Barley Wine" or "Barleywine style ale" (the latter
    due to legal requirements, not brewery preference).
  comparison: The American version of the Barleywine tends to have a greater emphasis
    on hop bitterness, flavor and aroma than the English Barleywine, and often features
    American hop varieties. Typically paler than the darker English Barleywines (and
    lacking in the deeper malt flavors) but darker than the golden English Barleywines.
    Differs from a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward,
    and the body is fuller and often richer. An American Barleywine typically has
    more residual sweetness than a Double IPA, which affects the overall drinkability
    (sipping vs. drinking).

    Rogue Old Crustacean, Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, Victory Old Horizontal
  fg_high: 1.03
  fg_low: 1.016
  flavor: Strong, rich malt flavor with a noticeable hop flavor and bitterness in
    the balance. Moderately-low to moderately-high malty sweetness on the palate,
    although the finish may be somewhat sweet to quite dry (depending on aging). Hop
    bitterness may range from moderately strong to aggressive. While strongly malty,
    the balance should always seem bitter. Moderate to high hop flavor (any variety,
    but often showing a range of New World hop characteristics). Low to moderate fruity
    esters. Noticeable alcohol presence, but well-integrated. Flavors will smooth
    out and decline over time, but any oxidized character should be muted (and generally
    be masked by the hop character). May have some bready or caramelly malt flavors,
    but these should not be high; roasted or burnt malt flavors are inappropriate.
  history: Usually the strongest ale offered by a brewery, often associated with the
    winter or holiday season and vintage-dated. As with many American craft beer styles,
    derived from English examples but using American ingredients and featuring a much
    more forward hop profile. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor
    Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983,
    set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when
    Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said,
    "your barleywine is too bitter" – to which Sierra Nevada replied, "thank you."

  impression: A well-hopped American interpretation of the richest and strongest of
    the English ales. The hop character should be evident throughout, but does not
    have to be unbalanced. The alcohol strength and hop bitterness often combine to
    leave a very long finish.
  ingredients: Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist. Some
    specialty or character malts may be used. Dark malts should be used with great
    restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil. New World
    hops are common, although any varieties can be used in quantity. Generally uses
    an attenuative American ale yeast.
  mouthfeel: Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the
    body may decline with long conditioning). Alcohol warmth should be noticeable
    but smooth. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low
    to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.

    to moderately-strong bready, wheaty malt character, often with additional malt
    complexity such as honey and caramel. A light, clean, alcohol aroma may noted.
    Low to medium fruity notes may be apparent. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable
    but not required. Weizen yeast character (banana/clove) is inappropriate.

  class: beer
  comments: Dark malts should be used with restraint. Much of the color arises from
    a lengthy boil. Some commercial examples may be larger than the Vital Statistics,
    and some may not be brewed every year.
  comparison: More than simply a wheat-based barleywine, many versions have very expressive
    fruity and hoppy notes, while others develop complexity through oak aging. Less
    emphasis on the hops than American Barleywine. Has roots in American Wheat Beer
    rather than any German wheat styles, so should not have any German weizen yeast
    character.

    notes are a welcome complexity note, although not required. Hop flavor is low
    to medium, and can reflect any variety. Moderate to moderately-high fruitiness,
    often with a dried-fruit character. Hop bitterness may range from low to moderate;
    balance therefore ranges from malty to evenly balanced. Should not be syrupy and
    under-attenuated. Some oxidative or vinous flavors may be present, as are light
    alcohol notes that are clean and smooth but complex. A complementary, supportive
    oak character is welcome, but not required.
  history: A relatively recent American craft beer style that was first brewed at
    the Rubicon Brewing Company in 1988. Often a winter seasonal, vintage, or one-off
    release. Breweries frequently experiment with this style, leading to a range of
    interpretations.

  impression: A richly textured, high alcohol sipping beer with a significant grainy,
    bready flavor and sleek body. The emphasis is first on the bready, wheaty flavors
    with interesting complexity from malt, hops, fruity yeast character and alcohol
    complexity.
  ingredients: Typically brewed with a combination of American two-row and American
    wheat. Style commonly uses 50% or more wheat malt. Any variety of hops may be
    used. May be oak-aged.
  mouthfeel: Medium-full to full bodied and chewy, often with a luscious, velvety
    texture. Low to moderate carbonation. Light to moderate smooth alcohol warming
    may also be present.

  comments: In Germany, it is classified as a Schankbier denoting a small beer of
    starting gravity in the range 7-8 °P. Often served with the addition of a shot
    of sugar syrups (mit schuss) flavored with raspberry (himbeer), woodruff (waldmeister),
    or Caraway schnapps (Kümmel) to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described
    by some as the most purely refreshing beer in the world.
  comparison: Compared to a lambic, is generally not as acidic and has a clean lactic
    sourness with restrained to below sensory threshold funk. Also lower in alcohol
    content.

  flavor: Clean lactic sourness dominates and can be quite strong. Some complementary
    doughy, bready or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable. Hop bitterness
    is undetectable; sourness provides the balance rather than hops. Never vinegary.
    A restrained citrusy-lemony or tart apple fruitiness may be detected. Very dry
    finish. Balance dominated by sourness, but some malt flavor should be present.
    No hop flavor. May optionally have a restrained funky Brettanomyces character.
  history: A regional specialty of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809
    as "the Champagne of the North" due to its lively and elegant character. At one
    point, it was smoked and there used to be Märzen-strength (14 °P) version. Increasingly
    rare in German, but some American craft breweries now regularly produce the style.

  impression: A very pale, refreshing, low-alcohol German wheat beer with a clean
    lactic sourness and a very high carbonation level. A light bread dough malt flavor
    supports the sourness, which shouldn't seem artificial. Any Brettanomyces funk
    is restrained.
  ingredients: Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as is tradition with
    all German wheat beers) with the remainder typically being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic
    fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and Lactobacillus (various strains) provides
    the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages
    during fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is non-existent.
    Decoction mashing with mash hopping is traditional. German brewing scientists
    believe that Brettanomyces is essential to get the correct flavor profile, but
    this character is never strong.
  mouthfeel: Light body. Very high carbonation. No sensation of alcohol. Crisp, juicy
    acidity.

  comments: Long aging and blending of young and well-aged beer often occurs, adding
    to the smoothness and complexity, though the aged product is sometimes released
    as a connoisseur's beer. Known as the Burgundy of Belgium, it is more wine-like
    than any other beer style. The reddish color is a product of the malt although
    an extended, less-than-rolling portion of the boil may help add an attractive
    Burgundy hue. Aging will also darken the beer. The Flanders red is more acetic
    (but never vinegar-like) and the fruity flavors more reminiscent of a red wine
    than an Oud Bruin. Can have an apparent attenuation of up to 98%.
  comparison: Less malty-rich than an Oud Bruin, often with more of a fruity-tart
    profile.
  examples: Cuvée des Jacobins Rouge, Duchesse de Bourgogne, Rodenbach Grand Cru,
    Rodenbach Klassiek, Vichtenaar Flemish Ale
  fg_high: 1.012

  flavor: Intense fruitiness commonly includes plum, orange, black cherry or red currant
    flavors. A mild vanilla and/or chocolate character is often present. Spicy phenols
    can be present in low amounts for complexity. Sour flavor ranges from complementary
    to intense, and can have an acidic bite. Malty flavors range from complementary
    to prominent, and often have a soft toasty-rich quality. Generally as the sour
    character increases, the malt character blends to more of a background flavor
    (and vice versa). No hop flavor. Restrained hop bitterness. An acidic, tannic
    bitterness is often present in low to moderate amounts, and adds an aged red wine-like
    character and finish. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. Diacetyl
    is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor.
    Balanced to the malt side, but dominated by the fruity, sour, wine-like impression.
  history: An indigenous beer of West Flanders, typified by the products of the Rodenbach
    brewery, established in 1820 in West Flanders but reflective of earlier brewing
    traditions. The beer is aged for up to two years, often in huge oaken barrels
    which contain the resident bacteria necessary to sour the beer. It was once common
    in Belgium and England to blend old beer with young to balance the sourness and
    acidity found in aged beer. While blending of batches for consistency is now common
    among larger breweries, this type of blending is a fading art.

  impression: A sour, fruity, red wine-like Belgian-style ale with interesting supportive
    malt flavors and fruit complexity. The dry finish and tannin completes the mental
    image of a fine red wine.
  ingredients: A base of Vienna and/or Munich malts, light to medium cara-malts, and
    a small amount of Special B are used with up to 20% maize. Low alpha acid continental
    hops are commonly used (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces,
    Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation
    and eventual flavor.
  mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency,
    like a well-aged red wine, often with a prickly acidity. Deceivingly light and
    crisp on the palate although a somewhat sweet finish is not uncommon.

    prunes. Medium low to medium high malt character of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle
    or chocolate. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. A sherry-like
    character may be present and generally denotes an aged example. A low sour aroma
    may be present, and can modestly increase with age but should not grow to a noticeable
    acetic/vinegary character. Hop aroma absent. Diacetyl is perceived only in very
    minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.

  comments: Long aging and blending of young and aged beer may occur, adding smoothness
    and complexity and balancing any harsh, sour character. This style was designed
    to lay down so examples with a moderate aged character are considered superior
    to younger examples. As in fruit lambics, Oud Bruin can be used as a base for
    fruit-flavored beers such as kriek (cherries) or frambozen (raspberries), though
    these should be entered in the Classic-Style Fruit Beer category.
  comparison: A deeper malt character distinguishes these beers from Flanders red
    ales. The Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity
    flavors are more malt-oriented.

    Petrus Oud Bruin, Riva Vondel, Vanderghinste Bellegems Bruin

  flavor: Malty with fruity complexity and typically some caramel character. Medium
    to medium-high fruitiness commonly includes dark or dried fruit such as raisins,
    plums, figs, dates, black cherries or prunes. Medium low to medium high malt character
    of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle or chocolate. Spicy phenols can be present
    in low amounts for complexity. A slight sourness often becomes more pronounced
    in well-aged examples, along with some sherry-like character, producing a "sweet-and-sour"
    profile. The sourness should not grow to a notable acetic/vinegary character.
    Hop flavor absent. Restrained hop bitterness. Low oxidation is appropriate as
    a point of complexity. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if
    at all, as a complementary flavor. Balance is malty, but with fruitiness and sourness
    present. Sweet and tart finish
  history: An "old ale" tradition, indigenous to East Flanders, typified by the products
    of the Liefman brewery (now owned by Riva), which has roots back to the 1600s.
    Historically brewed as a "provision beer" that would develop some sourness as
    it aged. These beers were typically more sour than current commercial examples.
    While Flanders red beers are aged in oak, the brown beers are warm aged in stainless
    steel.

  impression: A malty, fruity, aged, somewhat sour Belgian-style brown ale.
  ingredients: A base of Pils malt with judicious amounts of dark cara malts and a
    tiny bit of black or roast malt. Often includes maize. Low alpha acid continental
    hops are typical (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces
    and Lactobacillus (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual
    flavor. Lactobacillus reacts poorly to elevated levels of alcohol. Water high
    in carbonates is typical of its home region and will buffer the acidity of darker
    malts and the lactic sourness. Magnesium in the water accentuates the sourness.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation. No astringency.

    favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. Older

  comments: Straight lambics are single-batch, unblended beers. Since they are unblended,
    the straight lambic is often a true product of the "house character" of a brewery
    and will be more variable than a gueuze. They are generally served young (6 months)
    and on tap as cheap, easy-drinking beers without any filling carbonation. Younger
    versions tend to be one-dimensionally sour since a complex Brett character often
    takes upwards of a year to develop. An enteric character is often indicative of
    a lambic that is too young. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered
    a fault by Belgian brewers. Since the wild yeast and bacteria will ferment ALL
    sugars, they are typically bottled only when they have completely fermented.
  comparison: Generally has a more simple sourness and complexity than a gueuze. Traditionally
    served uncarbonated from pitchers, while gueuze is bottled and very highly carbonated.
  examples: The only bottled version readily available is Cantillon Grand Cru Bruocsella
    of whatever single batch vintage the brewer deems worthy to bottle. De Cam sometimes
    bottles their very old (5 years) lambic. In and around Brussels there are specialty
    cafes that often have draught lambics from traditional brewers or blenders such
    as Boon, De Cam, Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, Lindemans, Timmermans and Girardin.
  fg_high: 1.01
  fg_low: 1.001
  flavor: Young examples are often noticeably lactic-sour, but aging can bring this
    character more in balance with the malt, wheat and barnyard characteristics. Fruity
    flavors are simpler in young lambics and more complex in the older examples, where
    they are reminiscent of apples or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey. Some
    citrus flavor (often grapefruit) is occasionally noticeable, and is desirable.
    The malt and wheat character are typically low with some bready-grainy notes.
    An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is low
    to none, and generally undetectable; sourness provides the balance. Typically
    has a dry finish. No hop flavor.
  history: Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels
    (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old.

  impression: A fairly sour, often moderately funky wild Belgian wheat beer with sourness
    taking the place of hop bitterness in the balance. Traditionally spontaneously
    fermented in the Brussels area and served uncarbonated, the refreshing acidity
    makes for a very pleasant café drink.
  ingredients: Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used.
    The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes
    actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditionally these beers are
    spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately
    oaken barrels. The barrels used are neutral with little oak character, so don't
    expect a fresh or forward oak character – more neutral is typical. Home-brewed
    and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast
    commonly including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus
    in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and
    the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles
    are sometimes used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still
    viable.
  mouthfeel: Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the
    many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from feeling like water. As a rule
    of thumb, lambic dries with age, which makes dryness a reasonable indicator of
    age. Has a medium to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent.
    Traditional versions are virtually to completely uncarbonated, but bottled examples
    can pick up moderate carbonation with age.

  comments: Gueuze is traditionally produced by mixing one, two, and three-year old
    lambic. "Young" lambic contains fermentable sugars while old lambic has the characteristic
    "wild" taste of the Senne River valley. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character
    is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. A good gueuze is not the most pungent,
    but possesses a full and tantalizing bouquet, a sharp aroma, and a soft, velvety
    flavor. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while gueuze is served effervescent. Products
    marked oude or ville are considered most traditional.
  comparison: More complex and carbonated than a lambic. The sourness isn't necessarily
    higher, but it tends to have more of a well-developed wild character.

  flavor: A moderately sour character is classically in balance with the malt, wheat
    and barnyard characteristics. A low, complementary sweetness may be present but
    higher levels are not traditional. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance
    is the key and denotes a better gueuze. A varied fruit flavor is common, and can
    have a honey-like character. A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally
    noticeable. The malt is generally low and bready-grainy. An enteric, smoky or
    cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally absent but a
    very low hop bitterness may occasionally be perceived; sourness provides most
    of the balance. Crisp, dry, and tart finish. No hop flavor.
  history: Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels

  appearance: The variety of fruit generally determines the color, although lighter-colored
    fruit may have little effect on the color. The color intensity may fade with age.
    Clarity is often good, although some fruit will not drop bright. A thick rocky,
    mousse-like head, sometimes a shade of fruit, is generally long-lasting (carbonation-dependent).
    Carbonation is typically high, but must be specified.
  aroma: The specified fruit should be the dominant aroma. A low to moderately sour
    character blends with aromas described as barnyard, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey,
    and horse blanket (and thus should be recognizable as a lambic). The fruit aroma
    commonly blends well with the other aromas. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or

  comments: Fruit-based lambics are often produced like gueuze by mixing one, two,
    and three-year old lambic. "Young" lambic contains fermentable sugars while old
    lambic has the characteristic "wild" taste of the Senne River valley. Fruit is
    commonly added halfway through aging and the yeast and bacteria will ferment all
    sugars from the fruit. Fruit may also be added to unblended lambic. The most traditional
    styles of fruit lambics include kriek (cherries), framboise (raspberries) and
    druivenlambik (muscat grapes). IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used;
    Belgians use hops for anti-bacterial properties more than bittering in lambics.
  comparison: A lambic with fruit, not just a fruit beer; the wild lambic character
    must be evident.

  flavor: The specified fruit should be evident. Low to moderately sour flavor, often
    with an acidic bite in the finish. The classic barnyard characteristics may be
    low to high. When young, the beer will present its full fruity taste. As it ages,
    the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit character—thus
    fruit lambics are not intended for long aging. The finish is commonly dry and
    tart, but a low, complementary sweetness may be present; higher sweetness levels
    are not traditional but can be included for personal preference (sweetness level
    must be specified). A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally noticeable.
    An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally
    absent; acidity provides the balance. No hop flavor.

    centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling and some are untraditionally
    sweetening their products (post-fermentation) with sugar or sweet fruit to make
    them more palatable to a wider audience. Fruit was traditionally added to lambic
    or gueuze, either by the blender or publican, to increase the variety of beers
    available in local cafes.

  impression: A complex, fruity, pleasantly sour, wild wheat ale fermented by a variety
    of Belgian microbiota, and showcasing the fruit contributions blended with the
    wild character. The type of fruit can sometimes be hard to identify as fermented
    and aged fruit characteristics can seem different from the more recognizable fresh
    fruit aromas and flavors.
  ingredients: Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used.
    The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes
    actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditional products use 10-30%
    fruit (25%, if cherry). Fruits traditionally used include tart cherries (with
    pits), raspberries or Muscat grapes. More recent examples include peaches, apricots
    or merlot grapes. Tart or acidic fruit is traditionally used as its purpose is
    not to sweeten the beer but to add a new dimension. Traditionally these beers
    are spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately
    oaken barrels. The barrels used are old and have little oak character, so don't
    expect a fresh or forward oak character – more neutral is typical. Home-brewed
    and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast
    commonly including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus
    in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and
    the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles
    are sometimes used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still
    viable.
  mouthfeel: Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the
    many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from tasting like water. Has a low
    to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions
    have a light warming character. Carbonation can vary from sparkling to nearly
    still (must be specified).

  appearance: Very pale straw to very light gold in color. The beer will be very cloudy
    from starch haze and/or yeast, which gives it a milky, whitish-yellow appearance.
    Dense, white, moussy head. Head retention should be quite good.
  aroma: Moderate malty sweetness (often with light notes of honey and/or vanilla)
    with light, grainy, spicy wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Moderate
    perfumy coriander, often with a complex herbal, spicy, or peppery note in the
    background. Moderate zesty, citrusy-orangey fruitiness. A low spicy-herbal hop
    aroma is optional, but should never overpower the other characteristics. Vegetal,
    celery-like, or ham-like aromas are inappropriate. Spices should blend in with
    fruity, floral and sweet aromas and should not be overly strong.

  class: beer
  comments: The presence, character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies.
    Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander
    of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer
    tends to be fragile and does not age well, so younger, fresher, properly handled
    examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.
  comparison: Low bitterness level with a balance similar to a Weissbier, but with
    spice and citrus character coming from additions rather than the yeast.
  examples: Allagash White, Blanche de Bruxelles, Celis White, Hoegaarden Wit, Ommegang
    Witte, St. Bernardus Witbier, Wittekerke
  fg_high: 1.012

  flavor: Pleasant malty-sweet grain flavor (often with a honey and/or vanilla character)
    and a zesty, orange-citrusy fruitiness. Refreshingly crisp with a dry, often tart,
    finish. Can have a low bready wheat flavor. Optionally has a very light lactic-tasting
    sourness. Herbal-spicy flavors, which may include coriander and other spices,
    are common should be subtle and balanced, not overpowering. A spicy-earthy hop
    flavor is low to none, and if noticeable, never gets in the way of the spices.
    Hop bitterness is low to medium-low, and doesn't interfere with refreshing flavors
    of fruit and spice, nor does it persist into the finish. Bitterness from orange
    pith should not be present. Vegetal, celery-like, ham-like, or soapy flavors are
    inappropriate.
  history: A 400-year-old Belgian beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later
    revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden, and has grown steadily in popularity over
    time, both with modern craft brewers and mass-market producers who see it as a
    somewhat fruity summer seasonal beer.

  impression: A refreshing, elegant, tasty, moderate-strength wheat-based ale.
  ingredients: About 50% unmalted wheat and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt)
    constitute the grist. In some versions, up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices
    of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement
    the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g., chamomile, cumin,
    cinnamon, Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent.
    Ale yeast prone to the production of mild, spicy flavors is very characteristic.
    In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation, or the actual addition of
    lactic acid, is done.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, often having a smoothness and light creaminess
    from unmalted wheat and the occasional oats. Despite body and creaminess, finishes
    dry and often a bit tart. Effervescent character from high carbonation. Refreshing,
    from carbonation, light acidity, and lack of bitterness in finish. No harshness
    or astringency from orange pith. Should not be overly dry and thin, nor should
    it be thick and heavy.

  aroma: Moderate malt aroma, which can be a combination of toasty, biscuity, or nutty,
    possibly with a touch of light caramel or honey. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness
    with an orange- or pear-like character. Low to moderate strength hop character
    (spicy, herbal, or floral) optionally blended with background level peppery, spicy
    phenols. The hop character is lower in balance than the malt and fruitiness.

  category_notes: This category contains the maltier to balanced, more highly flavored
    Belgian and French ales.
  class: beer
  comments: Most commonly found in the Flemish provinces of Antwerp and Brabant. Considered
    "everyday" beers (Category I). Compared to their higher alcohol Category S cousins,
    they are Belgian "session beers" for ease of drinking. Nothing should be too pronounced
    or dominant; balance is the key. Yeast character generally more subtle than many
    Belgian beers, with some of the fruitiness being hop-driven.
  comparison: Fairly similar to pale ales from England (Strong Bitter category), typically
    with a slightly different yeast character and a more varied malt profile. Less
    yeast character than many other Belgian beers, though.
  examples: De Koninck, De Ryck Special, Palm Dobble, Palm Speciale
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Has an initial soft, smooth, moderately malty flavor with a variable profile
    of toasty, biscuity, nutty, light caramel and/or honey notes. Moderate to moderately
    high fruitiness, sometimes orange- or pear-like. Relatively light (medium-low
    to low) spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. The hop bitterness is medium-high
    to medium-low, and is optionally enhanced by low to very low amounts of peppery
    phenols. There is a dry to balanced finish, with hops becoming more pronounced
    in the aftertaste of those with a drier finish. Fairly well balanced overall,
    with no single component being high in intensity; malt and fruitiness are more
    forward initially with a supportive bitterness and drying character coming on
    late.
  history: Produced by breweries with roots as far back as the mid-1700s, the most
    well-known examples were perfected after the Second World War with some influence
    from Britain, including hops and yeast strains.

  impression: A moderately malty, somewhat fruity, easy-drinking, copper-colored Belgian
    ale that is somewhat less aggressive in flavor profile than many other Belgian
    beers. The malt character tends to be a bit biscuity with light toasty, honey-like,
    or caramelly components; the fruit character is noticeable and complementary to
    the malt. The bitterness level is generally moderate, but may not seem as high
    due to the flavorful malt profile.
  ingredients: Pilsner or pale ale malt contributes the bulk of the grist with (cara)
    Vienna and Munich malts adding color, body and complexity. Sugar is not commonly
    used as high gravity is not desired. Saazer-type hops, Styrian Goldings, East
    Kent Goldings or Fuggles are commonly used. Yeasts prone to moderate production
    of phenols are often used but fermentation temperatures should be kept moderate
    to limit this character.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-light body. Smooth palate. Alcohol level is restrained,
    and any warming character should be low if present. Medium to medium-high carbonation.

  appearance: Three main variations exist (blond, amber and brown), so color can range
    from golden-blonde to reddish-bronze to chestnut brown. Clarity is brilliant to
    fair, although haze is not unexpected in this type of often unfiltered beer. Well-formed
    head, generally white to off-white (varies by beer color), average persistence.
  aroma: Prominent malty sweetness, often with a complex, light to moderate intensity
    toasty-bready-rich malt character. Low to moderate esters. Little to no hop aroma
    (may be a bit spicy, peppery, or herbal). Paler versions will still be malty but
    will lack richer, deeper aromatics and may have a bit more hops. Generally quite
    clean, although stronger versions may have a light, spicy alcohol note as it warms.

  comments: 'Three main variations are included in the style: the brown (brune), the
    blond (blonde), and the amber (ambrée). The darker versions will have more malt
    character, while the paler versions can have more hops (but still are malt-focused
    beers). A related style is Bière de Mars, which is brewed in March (Mars) for
    present use and will not age as well. Attenuation rates are in the 80-85% range.
    Some fuller-bodied examples exist, but these are somewhat rare. Age and oxidation
    in imports often increases fruitiness, caramel flavors, and adds corked and musty
    notes; these are all signs of mishandling, not characteristic elements of the
    style.'
  comparison: Related to the Belgian Saison style, the main difference is that the
    Bière de Garde is rounder, richer, malt-focused, and lacks the spicy, bitter character
    of a Saison.

  flavor: Medium to high malt flavor often with a toasty-rich, biscuity, toffee-like
    or light caramel-sweet character. Malt flavors and complexity tend to increase
    with beer color. Low to moderate esters and alcohol flavors. Medium-low hop bitterness
    provides some support, but the balance is always tilted toward the malt. Darker
    versions will have more of an initial malty-sweet impression than paler versions,
    but all should be malty in the palate and finish. The malt flavor lasts into the
    finish, which is medium-dry to dry, never cloying. Low to no hop flavor (spicy,
    peppery, or herbal), although paler versions can have slightly higher levels of
    herbal or spicy hop flavor (which can also come from the yeast). Smooth, well-lagered
    character, even if made with ale yeast. Aftertaste of malt (character appropriate
    for the color) with some dryness and light alcohol.
  history: Name literally means "beer which has been kept or lagered." A traditional
    artisanal ale from Northern France brewed in early spring and kept in cold cellars
    for consumption in warmer weather. It is now brewed year-round.

  impression: A fairly strong, malt-accentuated, lagered artisanal beer with a range
    of malt flavors appropriate for the color. All are malty yet dry, with clean flavors
    and a smooth character.
  ingredients: The "cellar" character commonly described in literature is more of
    a feature of mishandled commercial exports than fresh, authentic products. The
    somewhat moldy character comes from the corks and/or oxidation in commercial versions,
    and is incorrectly identified as "musty" or "cellar-like." Base malts vary by
    beer color, but usually include pale, Vienna and Munich types. Darker versions
    will have richer malt complexity and sweetness from crystal-type malts. Sugar
    may be used to add flavor and aid in the dry finish. Lager or ale yeast fermented
    at cool ale temperatures, followed by long cold conditioning. Floral, herbal or
    spicy continental hops.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-light (lean) body, often with a smooth, creamy-silky
    character. Moderate to high carbonation. Moderate alcohol warming, but should
    be very smooth and never hot.

    produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, Saazer-type, Styrian Goldings,
    or East Kent Goldings hops. Spices are not traditionally used, although the ingredients
    and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing (often reminiscent
    of oranges or lemons). If spices are present, should be a background character

  appearance: Pale versions are often a distinctive pale orange but may be pale golden
    to amber in color (gold to amber-gold is most common). Darker versions may run
    from copper to dark brown. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head resulting
    in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor to good,
    though haze is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered beer. Effervescent.
  aroma: Quite aromatic, with fruity, spicy, and hoppy characteristics evident. The
    esters can be fairly high (moderate to high), and are often reminiscent of citrus
    fruits such as oranges or lemons. The hops are low to moderate and are often spicy,
    floral, earthy, or fruity. Stronger versions can have a soft, spicy alcohol note
    (low intensity). Spicy notes are typically peppery rather than clove-like, and
    can be up to moderately-strong (typically yeast-derived). Subtle, complementary
    herb or spice additions are allowable, but should not dominate. The malt character
    is typically slightly grainy in character and low in intensity. Darker and stronger
    versions will have more noticeable malt, with darker versions taking characteristics
    associated with grains of that color (toasty, biscuity, caramelly, chocolate,
    etc.). In versions where sourness is present instead of bitterness, some of the
    sour character can be detected (low to moderate).
  category_id: '2'
  category_name: Strong Belgian Ale
  category_notes: This category contains the pale, well-attenuated, balanced to bitter
    beers, often more driven by yeast character than malt flavors, with generally
    higher alcohol (although a range exists within styles).
  class: beer
  comments: Variations exist in strength and color, but they all have similar characteristics
    and balance, in particularly the refreshing, highly-attenuated, dry character
    with high carbonation. There is no correlation between strength and color. The
    balance can change somewhat with strength and color variations, but the family
    resemblance to the original artisanal ale should be evident. Pale versions are
    likely to be more bitter and have more hop character, while darker versions tend
    to have more malt character and sweetness, yielding a more balanced presentations.
    Stronger versions often will have more malt flavor, richness, and body simply
    due to their higher gravity. Although they tend to be very well-attenuated, they
    may not be perceived to be as dry as standard-strength saisons due to their strength.
    The Saison yeast character is a must, although maltier and richer versions will
    tend to mask this character more. Often called Farmhouse ales in the US, but this
    term is not common in Europe where they are simply part of a larger grouping of
    artisanal ales.
  comparison: At standard strengths and pale color (the most common variety), like
    a more highly-attenuated, hoppy, and bitter Belgian blond ale with a stronger
    yeast character. At super strength and pale color, similar to a Belgian tripel,
    but often with more of a grainy, rustic quality and sometimes with a spicier yeast
    character.

  flavor: Medium-low to medium-high fruity and spicy flavors, supported by a low to
    medium soft malt character, often with some grainy flavors. Bitterness is typically
    moderate to high, although sourness can be present in place of bitterness (both
    should not be strong flavors at the same time). Attenuation is extremely high,
    which gives a characteristic dry finish essential to the style; a Saison should
    never finish sweet. The fruity character is frequently citrusy (orange or lemon),
    and the spices are typically peppery. Allow for a range of balance in the fruity-spicy
    characteristics; this is often driven by the yeast selection. Hop flavor is low
    to moderate, and generally spicy or earthy in character. The balance is towards
    the fruity, spicy, hoppy character, with any bitterness or sourness not overwhelming
    these flavors. Darker versions will have more malt character, with a range of
    flavors derived from darker malts (toasty, bready, biscuity, chocolate, etc.)
    that support the fruity-spicy character of the beer (roasted flavors are not typical).
    Stronger versions will have more malt flavor in general, as well as a light alcohol
    impression. Herbs and spices are completely optional, but if present should be
    used in moderation and not detract from the yeast character. The finish is very
    dry and the aftertaste is typically bitter and spicy. The hop bitterness can be
    restrained, although it can seem accentuated due to the high attenuation levels.
  history: A provision ale originally brewed in Wallonia, the French-speaking part
    of Belgium, for consumption during the active farming season. Originally a lower-alcohol
    product so as to not debilitate field workers, but tavern-strength products also
    existed. Higher-strength and different-colored products appeared after WWII. The
    best known modern saison, Saison Dupont, was first produced in the 1920s. Originally
    a rustic, artisanal ale made with local farm-produced ingredients, it is now brewed
    mostly in larger breweries yet retains the image of its humble origins.

  impression: Most commonly, a pale, refreshing, highly-attenuated, moderately-bitter,
    moderate-strength Belgian ale with a very dry finish. Typically highly carbonated,
    and using non-barley cereal grains and optional spices for complexity, as complements
    the expressive yeast character that is fruity, spicy, and not overly phenolic.
    Less common variations include both lower-alcohol and higher-alcohol products,
    as well as darker versions with additional malt character.
  ingredients: Not typically spiced, with the yeast, hops and grain providing the
    character; but spices are allowed if they provide a complementary character. Continental
    base malts are typical, but the grist frequently contains other grains such as
    wheat, oats, rye, or spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to
    add complexity and dry out the beer. Darker versions will typically use richer,
    darker malts, but not typically roasted types. Saazer-type, Styrian or East Kent
    Golding hops are commonly used. A wide range of herbs or spices can add complexity
    and uniqueness, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character.
    Brettanomyces is not typical for this style; Saisons with Brett should be entered
    in the American Wild Ale category.
  mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Alcohol sensation varies with strength, from none
    in table version to light in standard versions, to moderate in super versions.
    However, any warming character should be fairly low. Very high carbonation with
    an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity on the tongue to balance
    the very dry finish. In versions with sourness, a low to moderate tart character
    can add a refreshing bite, but not be puckering (optional).

  class: beer
  comments: References to the devil are included in the names of many commercial examples
    of this style, referring to their potent alcoholic strength and as a tribute to
    the original example (Duvel). The best examples are complex and delicate. High
    carbonation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception
    of a dry finish. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or refermented in the bottle).
  comparison: Strongly resembles a Tripel, but may be even paler, lighter-bodied and
    even crisper and drier; the drier finish and lighter body also serves to make
    the assertive hopping and yeast character more prominent. Tends to use yeast that
    favor ester development (particularly pome fruit) over spiciness in the balance.

  flavor: Marriage of fruity, spicy and alcohol flavors supported by a soft malt character.
    Esters are reminiscent of pears, oranges or apples. Low to moderately low phenols
    are peppery in character. A low to moderate spicy hop character is often present.
    Alcohols are soft and spicy, and are low-to-moderate in intensity. Bitterness
    is typically medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced
    phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness leads to a dry finish with a
    low to moderately bitter aftertaste.
  history: Originally developed by the Moortgat brewery after WWI as a response to
    the growing popularity of Pilsner beers.

  impression: A pale, complex, effervescent, strong Belgian-style ale that is highly
    attenuated and features fruity and hoppy notes in preference to phenolics.
  ingredients: Pilsner malt with substantial sugary adjuncts. Saazer-type hops or
    Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used – those that
    produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly
    warmer fermentation temperatures. Fairly soft water. Spicing is not traditional;
    if present, should be a background character only.
  mouthfeel: Very highly carbonated; effervescent. Light to medium body, although
    lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Smooth but noticeable alcohol
    warmth. No hot alcohol or solventy character.

  appearance: Pale yellow to medium gold color. Generally good clarity, with a moderate-sized,
    persistent, billowy white head with characteristic lacing.
  aroma: Medium-low to medium-high Trappist yeast character, showing a fruity-spicy
    character along with medium-low to medium spicy or floral hops, occasionally enhanced
    by light herbal/citrusy spice additions. Low to medium-low grainy-sweet malt backdrop,
    which may have a light honey or sugar quality. Fruit expression can vary widely
    (citrus, pome fruit, stone fruit). Light spicy, yeast-driven phenolics found in
    the best examples. Bubblegum inappropriate.

  category_notes: Trappist is a protected legal appellation, and cannot be used commercially
    except by genuine Trappist monasteries that brew their own beer. However, we can
    use it to describe the type or styles of beer produced by those breweries and
    those who make beers of a similar style. Trappist type beers are all characterized
    by very high attenuation, high carbonation through bottle conditioning, and interesting
    (and often aggressive) yeast character.
  class: beer
  comments: Often not labeled or available outside the monastery, or infrequently
    brewed. Might also be called monk's beer or Brother's beer. Highly attenuated,
    generally 85% or higher.
  comparison: Like a top-fermented Belgian/Trappist interpretation of a German Pils
    – pale, hoppy, and well-attenuated, but showing prototypical Belgian yeast character.
    Has less sweetness, higher attenuation, less character malt, and is more hop-centered
    than a Belgian Pale Ale. More like a much smaller, more highly hopped tripel than
    a smaller Belgian Blond Ale.
  examples: Achel 5° Blond, St. Bernardus Extra 4, Westmalle Extra, Westvleteren Blond
  fg_high: 1.01
  fg_low: 1.004
  flavor: Fruity, hoppy, bitter, and dry. Initial malty-sweet impression, with a grainy-sweet
    soft malt palate, and a dry, hoppy finish. The malt may have a light honeyed biscuit
    or cracker impression. Moderate spicy or floral hop flavor. Esters can be citrus
    (orange, lemon, grapefruit), pome fruit (apple, pear), or stone fruit (apricot,
    peach). Light to moderate spicy, peppery, or clove phenolics. Bitterness rises
    towards the crisp, dry finish, with an aftertaste of light malt, moderate hops
    and yeast character.
  history: While Trappist breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer
    as a monk's daily ration, the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively
    modern invention reflecting current tastes. Westvleteren first brewed theirs in
    1999, but replaced older lower-gravity products.

  appearance: Dark amber to copper in color, with an attractive reddish depth of color.
    Generally clear. Large, dense, and long-lasting creamy off-white head.
  aroma: Complex, rich-sweet malty aroma, possibly with hints of chocolate, caramel
    and/or toast (but never roasted or burnt aromas). Moderate fruity esters (usually
    including raisins and plums, sometimes also dried cherries). Esters sometimes
    include banana or apple. Spicy phenols and higher alcohols are common (may include
    light clove and spice, peppery, rose-like and/or perfumy notes). Spicy qualities
    can be moderate to very low. Alcohol, if present, is soft and never hot or solventy.
    Low to no spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma, typically absent. The malt is most
    prominent in the balance with esters and a touch of alcohol in support, blending
    together for a harmonious presentation.

  comparison: Should not be as malty as a bock and should not have crystal malt-type
    sweetness. Similar in strength and balance as a Belgian Blond, but with a richer
    malt and ester profile. Less strong and intense as a Belgian Dark Strong Ale.

  flavor: Similar qualities as aroma. Rich, complex medium to medium-full rich-sweet
    malt flavor on the palate yet finishes moderately dry. Complex malt, ester, alcohol
    and phenol interplay (raisiny flavors are common; dried fruit flavors are welcome;
    clove or pepper spiciness is optional). Balance is always toward the malt. Medium-low
    bitterness that doesn't persist into the aftertaste. Low spicy, floral, or herbal
    hop flavor is optional and not usually present.

  impression: A deep reddish-copper, moderately strong, malty, complex Trappist ale
    with rich malty flavors, dark or dried fruit esters, and light alcohol blended
    together in a malty presentation that still finishes fairly dry.
  ingredients: Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters,
    and phenolics are commonly used. Impression of complex grain bill, although traditional
    versions are typically Belgian Pils malt with caramelized sugar syrup or other
    unrefined sugars providing much of the character. Saazer-type, English-type or
    Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. No spices are traditionally used, although
    restrained use is allowable (background strength only).
  mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation, which can influence the perception
    of body. Low alcohol warmth. Smooth, never hot or solventy.

  appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent. Long-lasting,
    creamy, rocky, white head resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass
    as it fades.
  aroma: Complex bouquet with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate fruity esters
    and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery, sometimes clove-like
    phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges, but may
    sometimes have a slight banana character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral,
    sometimes perfumy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and
    low in intensity. The malt character is light, with a soft, slightly grainy-sweet
    or slightly honey-like impression. The best examples have a seamless, harmonious
    interplay between the yeast character, hops, malt, and alcohol.

    (and often aggressive) yeast character.
  class: beer
  comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The best examples
    are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and attenuation helps to bring out the
    many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions
    have at least 30 IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or refermented
    in the bottle).
  comparison: May resemble a Belgian Golden Strong Ale but slightly darker and somewhat
    fuller-bodied, with more emphasis on phenolics and less on esters. Usually has
    a more rounded malt flavor but should never be sweet.
  examples: Affligem Tripel, Chimay Cinq Cents, La Rulles Tripel, La Trappe Tripel,
    St. Bernardus Tripel, Unibroue La Fin Du Monde, Val-Dieu Triple, Watou Tripel,
    Westmalle Tripel
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.008
  flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a soft, rounded
    grainy-sweet malt impression, occasionally with a very light honey note. Low to
    moderate phenols are peppery in character. Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit
    such as orange or sometimes lemon, and are low to moderate. A low to moderate
    spicy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy, and low in intensity.
    Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and
    yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness lends a dry finish
    with a moderately bitter aftertaste with substantial spicy-fruity yeast character.
    The grainy-sweet malt flavor does not imply any residual sweetness.
  history: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at Westmalle.

  impression: A pale, somewhat spicy, dry, strong Trappist ale with a pleasant rounded
    malt flavor and firm bitterness. Quite aromatic, with spicy, fruity, and light
    alcohol notes combining with the supportive clean malt character to produce a
    surprisingly drinkable beverage considering the high alcohol level.
  ingredients: Pilsner malt, typically with pale sugar adjuncts. Saazer-type hops
    or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used – those
    that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols – often aided
    by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Spice additions are generally not
    traditional, and if used, should be a background character only. Fairly soft water.
  mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity
    would suggest. Highly carbonated. The alcohol content is deceptive, and has little
    to no obvious warming sensation. Always effervescent.

  appearance: Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (dark in this context implies
    more deeply colored than golden). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light
    tan-colored head. Can be clear to somewhat hazy.
  aroma: Complex, with a rich-sweet malty presence, significant esters and alcohol,
    and an optional light to moderate spiciness. The malt is rich and strong, and
    can have a deep bready-toasty quality often with a deep caramel complexity. The
    fruity esters are strong to moderately low, and can contain raisin, plum, dried
    cherry, fig or prune notes. Spicy phenols may be present, but usually have a peppery
    quality not clove-like; light vanilla is possible. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy
    and/or rose-like, and are low to moderate in intensity. Hops are not usually present
    (but a very low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is acceptable). No dark/roast
    malt aroma. No hot alcohols or solventy aromas.

    bottle-conditioned (or refermented in the bottle). Sometimes known as a Trappist
    Quadruple, most are simply known by their strength or color designation.

  flavor: Similar to aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply
    to flavor as well). Moderately malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet
    impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry finish, although
    may be up to moderately sweet. Medium-low to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides
    some of the balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly
    even with bitterness. The complex and varied flavors should blend smoothly and
    harmoniously. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.

    beer style that is not described elsewhere in these guidelines. In the case of
    a style that has changed substantially over the years (such as Porter or Stout),

  class: beer
  comments: Served in traditional cylindrical glasses. Historical versions may have
    been more sour than modern examples due to spontaneous fermentation, and may be
    blended with syrups as is done with Berliner Weisse, or Kümmel, a liqueur flavored
    with caraway, cumin, and fennel. Modern examples are inoculated with lactobacillus,
    and are more balanced and generally don't need sweetening. Pronounced GOH-zeh.
  comparison: Perceived acidity is not as intense as Berliner Weisse or Gueuze. Restrained
    use of salt, coriander, and lactobacillus – should not taste overtly salty. Coriander
    aroma can be similar to a witbier. Haziness similar to a Weissbier.

  flavor: Moderate to restrained but noticeable sourness, like a squeeze of lemon
    in iced tea. Moderate bready/doughy malt flavor. Light to moderate fruity character
    of pome fruit, stone fruit, or lemons. Light to moderate salt character, up to
    the threshold of taste; the salt should be noticeable (particularly in the initial
    taste) but not taste overtly salty. Low bitterness, no hop flavor. Dry, fully-attenuated
    finish, with acidity not hops balancing the malt. Acidity can be more noticeable
    in the finish, and enhance the refreshing quality of the beer. The acidity should
    be balanced, not forward (although historical versions could be very sour).
  history: Minor style associated with Leipzig but originating in the Middle Ages
    in the town of Goslar on the Gose River. Documented to have been in Leipzig by
    1740. Leipzig was said to have 80 Gose houses in 1900. Production declined significantly
    after WWII, and ceased entirely in 1966. Modern production was revived in the
    1980s, but the beer is not widely available.

  impression: A highly-carbonated, tart and fruity wheat ale with a restrained coriander
    and salt character and low bitterness. Very refreshing, with bright flavors and
    high attenuation.
  ingredients: Pilsner and wheat malt, restrained use of salt and coriander seed,
    lactobacillus. The coriander should have a fresh, citrusy (lemon or bitter orange),
    bright note, and not be vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like. The salt should have
    a sea salt or fresh salt character, not a metallic, iodine note.
  mouthfeel: High to very high carbonation, effervescent. Medium-light to medium-full
    body. Salt may give a slightly tingly, mouthwatering quality, if perceived at
    all. The yeast and wheat can give it a little body, but it shouldn't have a heavy

  class: beer
  comments: Modern characterizations of the style often mention a lactic sourness
    or sour mashing, but extensive brewing records from the larger breweries at the
    turn of the century have no indication of long acid rests, sour mashing, or extensive
    conditioning. This is likely a modern homebrewer invention, based on the supposition
    that since indigenous Bourbon distillers used a sour mash, beer brewers must also
    have used this process. No contemporaneous records indicate sour mashing or that
    the beer had a sour profile; rather the opposite, that the beer was brewed as
    an inexpensive, present-use ale. Enter soured versions in American Wild Ale.
  comparison: Like a darker-colored cream ale emphasizing corn, but with some light
    character malt flavor. Malt flavors and balance are probably closest to modern
    adjunct-driven international amber or dark lagers, Irish red ales, or Belgian
    pale ales.
  examples: Apocalypse Brew Works Ortel's 1912
  fg_high: 1.018
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Moderate grainy-sweet maltiness with low to medium-low caramel, toffee,
    bready, and/or biscuity notes. Generally light palate flavors typical of adjunct
    beers; a low grainy, corn-like sweetness is common. Medium to low floral or spicy
    hop flavor. Medium to low hop bitterness, which should neither be coarse nor have
    a harsh aftertaste. May exhibit light fruitiness. Balance in the finish is towards
    the malt. May have a lightly flinty or minerally-sulfate flavor in the finish.
    The finish is fairly dry, including the contributions of roasted grains and minerals.
    No sourness.
  history: A true American original style, Kentucky Common was almost exclusively
    produced and sold around the Louisville Kentucky metropolitan area from some time
    after the Civil War up to Prohibition. Its hallmark was that it was inexpensive
    and quickly produced, typically 6 to 8 days from mash to delivery. The beer was
    racked into barrels while actively fermenting (1.020 – 1.022) and tightly bunged
    to allow carbonation in the saloon cellar. There is some speculation that it was
    a variant of the lighter common or cream ale produced throughout much of the East
    prior to the Civil War and that the darker grains were added by the mostly Germanic
    brewers to help acidify the typical carbonate water of the Louisville area, or
    that they had a preference for darker colored beers. Up until the late 19th century,
    Kentucky Common was not brewed in the summer months unless cellars, usually used
    for malting, were used for fermentation. With the advent of ice machines, the
    larger breweries were able to brew year round. In the period from 1900 to prohibition,
    about 75% of the beer sold in the Louisville area was Kentucky Common. With prohibition,
    the style died completely as the few larger breweries that survived were almost
    exclusively lager producers.

  impression: A darker-colored, light-flavored, malt-accented beer with a dry finish
    and interesting character malt flavors. Refreshing due to its high carbonation
    and mild flavors, and highly sessionable due to being served very fresh and with
    restrained alcohol levels.
  ingredients: Six-row barley malt was used with 35% corn grits to dilute the excessive
    protein levels along with 1 to 2% each caramel and black malt. Native American
    hops, usually about .2 pounds per barrel of Western hops for bittering and a similar
    amount of New York hops (such as Clusters) for flavor (15 minutes prior to knock
    out). Imported continental Saazer-type hops (.1 pounds per barrel) were added
    at knock out for aroma. Water in the Louisville area was typically moderate to
    high in carbonates. Mash water was often pre-boiled to precipitate the carbonate
    and Gypsum was commonly added. Considering the time from mash in to kegging for
    delivery was typically 6 to 8 days, clearly aggressive top-fermenting yeasts was
    used.
  mouthfeel: Medium to medium-light body with a relatively soft mouthfeel. Highly
    carbonated. Can have a creamy texture.

    fruity esters, possibly apples or lemons, moderate bready-grainy malt. The smoke
    character is stronger than the bready notes, and the smoke has a ‘dry' character,
    like the remnants of an old fire, not a ‘greasy' smoke.

  comments: Served young. Smoke and sour is an unusual combination that is not for
    everyone.
  comparison: In the same general historical lower-alcohol top-fermenting central
    European wheat beer family as Gose, Grodziskie, and Berliner weisse, has elements
    of all of them but having its own unique balance – sour and smoke is not found
    in any of the other beers. Not as acidic as Berliner weisse, probably more like
    a smoked Gose without coriander and salt, or a Grodziskie with Gose-like acidity.
  fg_high: 1.008
  fg_low: 1.004
  flavor: Moderately strong fruity flavor, possibly lemons or apples. Moderate intensity,
    clean lactic tartness (no funk). Similar smoky character as aroma (dry wood fire),
    medium strength. Dry finish, with acidity and smoke in the aftertaste. Low bitterness;
    the acidity is providing the balance, not hops. Fresh, clean palate and slightly
    puckery aftertaste. The wheat character is on the low side; the smoke and acidity
    are more prominent in the balance. The lemony-tart/green apple flavor is strongest
    in the finish, with smoke a close second. Complex.
  history: Originating in Lichtenhain, in Thüringen (central Germany). Height of popularity
    was towards the end of the 1800s, and was widely available throughout Thüringen.
    Like a pre-1840 Berliner Weisse.

  class: beer
  comments: Increasingly rare; Mann's has over 90% market share in Britain, but in
    an increasingly small segment. Always bottled. Frequently used as a sweet mixer
    with cask mild and bitter in pubs. Commercial versions can be pasteurized and
    back-sweetened, which gives more of a sugary-sweet flavor.
  comparison: May seem somewhat like a less roasty version of a sweet stout (and lower-gravity,
    at least for US sweet stout examples) or a sweet version of a dark mild.
  examples: Harveys Bloomsbury Brown Ale, Mann's Brown Ale
  fg_high: 1.015
  fg_low: 1.012
  flavor: Deep, caramel or toffee-like malty and sweet flavor on the palate and lasting
    into the finish. Hints of biscuit and coffee are common. Some fruity esters can
    be present (typically dark fruit); relatively clean fermentation profile for an
    English ale. Low hop bitterness. Hop flavor is low to non-existent, possibly earthy
    or floral in character. Moderately-low to no perceivable roasty or bitter black
    malt flavor. Moderately sweet finish with a smooth, malty aftertaste. May have
    a sugary-sweet flavor.
  history: Developed by Mann's as a bottled product in 1902. Claimed at the time to
    be "the sweetest beer in London." Pre-WWI versions were around 5% ABV, but same
    general balance. Declined in popularity in second half of 20th century, and now
    nearly extinct.

  impression: A luscious, sweet, malt-oriented dark brown ale, with caramel and toffee
    malt complexity and a sweet finish.
  ingredients: English pale ale malt as a base with a healthy proportion of darker
    caramel malts and often some roasted (black) malt and wheat malt (this is Mann's
    traditional grist – others can rely on dark sugars for color and flavor). Moderate
    to high carbonate water. English hop varieties are most authentic, though with
    low flavor and bitterness almost any type could be used. Post-fermentation sweetening
    with lactose or artificial sweeteners, or sucrose (if pasteurized).
  mouthfeel: Medium body, but the residual sweetness may give a heavier impression.
    Medium-low to medium carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth in texture, particularly
    for its gravity.

  appearance: Pale yellow to medium gold in color with excellent clarity. A tall,
    billowy, white, tightly-knit head with excellent retention is distinctive. Murkiness
    is a fault.
  aroma: Low to moderate oak wood smoke is the most prominent aroma component, but
    can be subtle and hard to detect. A low spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma is
    typically present, and should be lower than or equal to the smoke in intensity.
    Hints of grainy wheat are also detected in the best examples. The aroma is otherwise
    clean, although light pome fruit esters (especially ripe red apple or pear) are
    welcome. No acidity. Slight water-derived sulfury notes may be present.

  comments: 'Pronounced in English as "pivo grow-JEES-kee-uh" (meaning: Grodzisk beer).
    Known as Grätzer (pronounced "GRATE-sir") in German-speaking countries, and in
    some beer literature. Traditionally made using a multi-step mash, a long boil
    (~2 hours), and multiple strains of ale yeast. The beer is never filtered but
    Isinglass is used to clarify before bottle conditioning. Traditionally served
    in tall conical glassware to accommodate the vigorous foam stand.'
  comparison: Similar in strength to a Berliner Weisse, but never sour. Has a smoked
    character but less intense than in a Rauchbier.
  fg_high: 1.012
  fg_low: 1.006
  flavor: Moderately-low to medium oak smoke flavor up front which carries into the
    finish; the smoke can be stronger in flavor than in aroma. The smoke character
    is gentle, should not be acrid, and can lend an impression of sweetness. A moderate
    to strong bitterness is readily evident which lingers through the finish. The
    overall balance is toward bitterness. Low but perceptible spicy, herbal, or floral
    hop flavor. Low grainy wheat character in the background. Light pome fruit esters
    (red apple or pear) may be present. Dry, crisp finish. No sourness.
  history: Developed as a unique style centuries ago in the Polish city of Grodzisk
    (known as Grätz when ruled by Prussia and Germany). Its fame and popularity rapidly
    extended to other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20th century.
    Regular commercial production declined after WWII and ceased altogether in the
    early-mid 1990s. This style description describes the traditional version during
    its period of greatest popularity.

  impression: A low-gravity, highly-carbonated, light-bodied ale combining an oak-smoked
    flavor with a clean hop bitterness. Highly sessionable.
  ingredients: Grain bill usually consists entirely of oak-smoked wheat malt. Oak-smoked
    wheat malt has a different (and less intense) smoke character than German beechwood-smoked
    barley malt; it has a drier, crisper, leaner quality – a bacon/ham smoke flavor
    is inappropriate. Saazer-type hops (Polish, Czech or German), moderate hardness
    sulfate water, and a relatively clean and attenuative continental ale yeast fermented
    at moderate ale temperatures are traditional. German hefeweizen yeast or other
    strains with a phenol or strong ester character are inappropriate.
  mouthfeel: Light in body, with a crisp and dry finish. Carbonation is quite high
    and can add a slight carbonic bite or prickly sensation. No noticeable alcohol
    warmth.

  comments: The classic American Pilsner was brewed both pre-Prohibition and post-Prohibition
    with some differences. OGs of 1.050–1.060 would have been appropriate for pre-Prohibition
    beers while gravities dropped to 1.044–1.048 after Prohibition. Corresponding
    IBUs dropped from a pre-Prohibition level of 30–40 to 25–30 after Prohibition.
  comparison: Similar balance and bitterness as modern Czech Premium Pale Lagers,
    but exhibiting native American grains and hops from the era before US Prohibition.
    More robust, bitter, and flavorful than modern American pale lagers, and often
    with higher alcohol.
  examples: Anchor California Lager, Coors Batch 19, Little Harpeth Chicken Scratch
  fg_high: 1.015
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Medium to medium-high maltiness with a grainy flavor, and optionally a corn-like
    roundness and impression of sweetness. Substantial hop bitterness stands up to
    the malt and lingers through the dry finish. All malt and rice-based versions
    are often crisper, drier, and generally lack corn-like flavors. Medium to high
    hop flavor, with a rustic, floral, or herbal/spicy character. Medium to high hop
    bitterness, which should neither be overly coarse nor have a harsh aftertaste.
    Allow for a range of lager yeast character, as with modern American lagers, but
    generally fairly neutral.
  history: A version of Pilsner brewed in the USA by immigrant German brewers who
    brought the process and yeast with them, but who had to adapt their recipes to
    work with native hops and malt. This style died out after Prohibition but was
    resurrected by homebrewers in the 1990s. Few commercial versions are made, so
    the style still remains mostly a homebrew phenomenon.

  impression: A clean, refreshing, but bitter pale lager, often showcasing a grainy-sweet
    corn flavor. All malt or rice-based versions have a crisper, more neutral character.
    The higher bitterness level is the largest differentiator between this style and
    most modern mass-market pale lagers, but the more robust flavor profile also sets
    it apart.
  ingredients: Six-row barley with 20% to 30% flaked maize (corn) or rice to dilute
    the excessive protein levels; modern versions may be all malt. Native American
    hops such as Clusters, traditional continental hops, or modern noble-type crosses
    are also appropriate. Modern American hops such as Cascade are inappropriate.
    Water with a high mineral content can lead to an unpleasant coarseness in flavor
    and harshness in aftertaste. A wide range of lager yeast character can be exhibited,
    although modern versions tend to be fairly clean.
  mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderately rich, creamy mouthfeel. Smooth and well-lagered.
    Medium to high carbonation levels.

  comments: Rye is a huskless grain and is difficult to mash, often resulting in a
    gummy mash texture that is prone to sticking. Rye has been characterized as having
    the most assertive flavor of all cereal grains. It is inappropriate to add caraway
    seeds to a roggenbier (as some American brewers do); the rye character is traditionally
    from the rye grain only.
  comparison: A more distinctive variant of a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead
    of malted wheat. American Rye Beers will not have the weizen yeast character,
    and likely more hops.
  examples: Thurn und Taxis Roggen
  fg_high: 1.014
  fg_low: 1.01
  flavor: Grainy, moderately-low to moderately-strong spicy rye flavor, often having
    a hearty flavor reminiscent of rye or pumpernickel bread. Medium to medium-low
    bitterness allows an initial malt sweetness (sometimes with a bit of caramel)
    to be tasted before yeast and rye character takes over. Low to moderate weizen
    yeast character (banana, clove), although the balance can vary. Medium-dry, grainy
    finish with a lightly bitter (from rye) aftertaste. Low to moderate spicy, herbal,
    or floral hop flavor acceptable, and can persist into aftertaste.
  history: A specialty German rye beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria. Never
    a widely popular style, it has all but disappeared in modern times.

    versions have 60-65% rye). Remainder of grist can include pale malt, Munich malt,
    wheat malt, crystal malt and/or small amounts of debittered dark malts for color
    adjustment. Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and clove phenols.
    Light usage of Saazer-type hops in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Lower fermentation
    temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing ester formation. Decoction
    mash traditionally used (as with weissbiers).

    a style that has changed substantially over the years (such as Porter or Stout),
    the entrant may specify an existing BJCP style as well as an era (e.g., 1820 English
    Porter). When the entrant specifies any style not on the BJCP-supplied list, the
    entrant must provide a description of the style for the judges in sufficient detail
    to allow the beer to be judged. If a beer is entered with just a style name and
    no description, it is very unlikely that judges will understand how to judge it.

  comments: The use of rye doesn't mean that it should taste like caraway (a dominant
    flavor in rye bread). The use of juniper berries will give a flavor like gin (similarly
    flavored with juniper berries). The juniper acts a bit like hops in the balance
    and flavor, providing some counterpoint to the sweet malt.
  comparison: Strong resemblance to Weizenbocks, but sweet and thick with a rye and
    juniper character.
  fg_high: 1.02
  fg_low: 1.016
  flavor: Strong banana and moderate to moderately-high clove yeast character. Moderate
    grainy rye flavor. Low bitterness. Fairly sweet finish. Juniper can add a pine-like
    flavor; juniper berries can add a gin-like flavor; both should be complementary,
    not dominant. No noticeable hop flavor. Moderate caramel flavor but no roast.
    Multi-layered and complex, with kind of a wortiness that is unusual in other beer
    styles. Not sour.
  history: An indigenous traditional style from Finland; a farmhouse tradition for
    at least 500 years, often brewed for festive occasions like summer weddings, and
    consumed within a week or two of brewing. A similar tradition exists in Estonia,
    where the beer is known as koduolu.

  impression: A sweet, heavy, strong traditional Finnish beer with a rye, juniper,
    and juniper berry flavor and a strong banana-clove yeast character.
  ingredients: Malted barley along with malted and unmalted grains, often rye. Low
    hops. Juniper boughs used for lautering (traditionally in a hollowed-out log),
    but often producing a juniper/berry character. Often uses top-fermenting baker's
    yeast in a fast, warm fermentation (German Weizen yeast is a good substitute).
    Not boiled; a long mash steep is used, with a separately added hop tea.
  mouthfeel: Thick, viscous, and heavy with protein (no boil means no hot break).
    Nearly still to medium-low carbonation. Strongly warming from the alcohol level
    and young age, but often masked by sweetness.

- appearance: Variable by base style. Clarity can be variable, and depends on the
    base style and ingredients used. Some haze is not necessarily a fault.
  aroma: Variable by base style. Young Brett-fermented beers will possess more fruity
    notes (e.g., tropical fruit, stone fruit, or citrus), but this is variable by
    the strain(s) of Brett used. For 100% Brett beers heavily hopped with American
    hop varieties, the fermentation-derived flavors are often difficult to tease from
    the hop aromatics. Older 100% Brett beers may start to develop a little funk (e.g.,
    barnyard, wet hay, or slightly earthy or smoky notes), but this character should
    not dominate. If the beer is fermented with a brewer's yeast in addition to Brett,
    some of the character of the primary yeast may remain. A faint sourness is acceptable
    but should not be a prominent character.

  category_name: American Wild Ale
  category_notes: The name American Wild Ale is in common use by craft brewers and
    homebrewers. However, the word Wild does not imply that these beers are necessarily
    spontaneously-fermented; rather, it indicates that they are influenced by microbes
    other than traditional brewer's yeasts. This category is intended for a wide range
    of beers that do not fit traditional European sour or wild styles. All of the
    styles in this category are essentially specialty beers where many creative interpretations
    are possible, and the styles are defined only by the use of specific fermentation
    profiles and ingredients. As specialty styles, the mandatory description provided
    by the entrant is of the utmost importance to the judge. Throughout this category,
    Brett is used as an abbreviation for Brettanomyces. This is the term most craft
    brewers and homebrewers will use in conversation, if not in formal communications.
  class: beer
  comments: The base style describes most of the character of these beers, but the
    addition of Brett ensures a drier, thinner, and funkier product. Younger versions
    are brighter and fruitier, while older ones possess more depth of funk and may
    lose more of the base style character. Wood-aged versions should be entered in
    the Wild Specialty Beer style. The Brett character should always meld with the
    style; these beers should never be a ‘Brett bomb'. Note that Brett does not produce
    lactic acid.
  comparison: Compared to the same beer style without Brett, a Brett Beer will be
    drier, more highly attenuated, fruitier, lighter in body, and slightly funkier
    as it ages. Less sourness and depth than Belgian ‘wild' ales.
  examples: Boulevard Saison Brett, Hill Farmstead Arthur, Logsdon Seizoen Bretta,
    Russian River Sanctification, The Bruery Saison Rue, Victory Helios
  flavor: Variable by base style. Brett character may range from minimal to aggressive.
    Can be quite fruity (e.g., tropical fruit, berry, stone fruit, citrus), or have
    some smoky, earthy, or barnyard character. Should not be unpleasantly funky, such
    as Band-Aid, fetid, nail polish remover, cheese, etc. Light sourness is acceptable
    with the beer being lightly tart, but should not be truly sour. Always fruitier
    when young, gaining more funk with age. May not be acetic or lactic. Malt flavors
    are often less pronounced than in the base style, leaving a beer most often dry
    and crisp due to high attenuation by the Brett.
  history: Modern American craft beer interpretations of Belgian wild ales, or experimentations
    inspired by Belgian wild ales or historical English beers with Brett. 100% Brett
    beers gained popularity after the year 2000; Port Brewing Mo Betta Bretta was
    one of the first celebrated examples.
  id: 28A
  impression: Most often drier and fruitier than the base style suggests. Funky notes
    range from low to high, depending on the age of the beer and strain(s) of Brett
    used. Funkiness is generally restrained in younger 100% Brett examples, but tends
    to increase with age. May possess a light acidity, although this does not come
    from Brett.
  ingredients: Virtually any style of beer, fermented in any manner, then finished
    with one or more strains of Brett. Alternatively, a beer made with Brett as the
    sole fermentation strain.
  mouthfeel: Variable by base style. Generally a light body, lighter than what might
    be expected from the base style but an overly thin body is a fault. Generally
    moderate to high carbonation. Head retention is variable.

    of some lactobacillus strains.
  aroma: Variable by base style. The contribution of non-Saccharomyces microbes should
    be noticeable to strong, and often contribute a sour and/or funky, wild note.
    The best examples will display a range of aromatics, rather than a single dominant
    character. The aroma should be inviting, not harsh or unpleasant.

  comments: These beers may be aged in wood, but any wood character should not be
    a primary or dominant flavor. Sour beers are typically not bitter as these flavors
    clash. The base beer style becomes less relevant because the various yeast and
    bacteria tend to dominate the profile. Inappropriate characteristics include diacetyl,
    solvent, ropy/viscous texture, and heavy oxidation.
  comparison: A sour and/or funky version of a base style.
  examples: Boulevard Love Child, Cascade Vlad the Imp Aler, Jester King Le Petit
    Prince, Jolly Pumpkin Calabaza Blanca, Russian River Temptation, The Bruery Rueuze,
    The Bruery Tart of Darkness
  flavor: Variable by base style. Look for an agreeable balance between the base beer
    and the fermentation character. A range of results is possible from fairly high
    acidity/funk to a subtle, pleasant, harmonious beer. The best examples are pleasurable
    to drink with the esters and phenols complementing the malt and/or hops. The wild
    character can be prominent, but does not need to be dominating in a style with
    an otherwise strong malt/hop profile. Acidity should be firm yet enjoyable, but
    should not be biting or vinegary; prominent or objectionable/offensive acetic
    acid is a fault. Bitterness tends to be low, especially as sourness increases.

  mouthfeel: Variable by base style. Generally a light body, almost always lighter
    than what might be expected from the base style. Generally moderate to high carbonation,
    although often lower in higher alcohol examples.

  comments: A wild beer featuring fruit, herbs, spices, or wood based on a style other
    than lambic. Could be another Classic Style (normally sour or not), or something
    more generic. These beers may be aged in wood, but any wood character should not
    be a primary or dominant flavor.
  comparison: Like a fruit, herb, spice, or wood beer, but sour and/or funky.
  examples: Cascade Bourbonic Plague, Jester King Atrial Rubicite, New Belgium Eric's
    Ale, New Glarus Belgian Red, Russian River Supplication, The Lost Abbey Cuvee
    de Tomme
  flavor: Variable by base style. Should show the fruit, sour and/or funk of a wild
    fermentation, as well as the characteristics of the special ingredients used.
    Any fruit sweetness is generally gone, so only the esters typically remain from
    the fruit. The sour character from the fruit and wild fermentation could be prominent,
    but should not be overwhelming. The acidity and tannin from any fruit can both
    enhance the dryness of the beer, so care must be taken with the balance. The acidity
    should enhance the perception of the fruit flavor, not detract from it. Wood notes,
    if present, add flavor but should be balanced.

  impression: A sour and/or funky version of a fruit, herb, or spice beer, or a wild

    character.
  ingredients: Virtually any style of beer. Any combination of Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces,
    Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, or other similar fermenters. Can also be a blend of
    styles. While cherries, raspberries, and peaches are most common, other fruits
    can be used as well. Vegetables with fruit-like characteristics (chile, rhubarb,
    pumpkin, etc.) may also be used. Wood or barrel aging is very common, but not
    required.
  mouthfeel: Variable by base style. Generally a light body, lighter than what might
    be expected from the base style. Generally moderate to high carbonation; carbonation
    should balance the base style if one is declared. The presence of tannin from
    some fruit or wood can provide a slight astringency, enhance the body, or make
    the beer seem drier than it is.

    the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in beer is often
    lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different

  category_notes: The Fruit Beer category is for beer made with any fruit or combination
    of fruit under the definitions of this category. The culinary, not botanical,
    definition of fruit is used here – fleshy, seed-associated structures of plants
    that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state. Examples include pome fruit
    (apple, pear, quince), stone fruit (cherry, plum, peach, apricot, mango, etc.),
    berries (any fruit with the word ‘berry' in it), currants, citrus fruit, dried
    fruit (dates, prunes, raisins, etc.), tropical fruit (banana, pineapple, guava,
    papaya, etc.), figs, pomegranate, prickly pear, and so on. It does not mean spices,
    herbs, or vegetables as defined in Category 30, especially botanical fruit treated
    as culinary vegetables. Basically, if you have to justify a fruit using the word
    "technically" as part of the description, then that's not what we mean.
  class: beer
  comments: Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made fruit beer. The fruit
    should complement the original style and not overwhelm it. The key attributes
    of the underlying style will be different with the addition of fruit; do not expect
    the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based
    on the pleasantness and balance of the resulting combination.
  examples: Bell's Cherry Stout, Dogfish Head Aprihop, Ebulum Elderberry Black Ale,
    Founders Rübæus
  flavor: As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the declared
    fruit should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive.
    The balance of fruit with the underlying beer is vital, and the fruit character
    should not be so artificial and/or inappropriately overpowering as to suggest
    a ‘fruit juice drink.' Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content,
    and fermentation by-products, such as esters, should be appropriate to the base
    beer and be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive fruit flavors present.
    Remember that fruit generally add flavor not sweetness to fruit beers. The sugar
    found in fruit is usually fully fermented and contributes to lighter flavors and
    a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style. However, residual
    sweetness is not necessarily a negative characteristic unless it has a raw, unfermented
    quality.
  id: 29A
  impression: A harmonious marriage of fruit and beer, but still recognizable as a

  mouthfeel: Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate
    to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the declared
    base beer style. Fruit generally adds fermentables that tend to thin out the beer;
    the resulting beer may seem lighter than expected for the declared base style.
    Smaller and darker fruit have a tendency to add a tannic depth that should overwhelm
    the base beer.

  comments: Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made fruit and spice beer.
    The fruit and spice should each complement the original style and not overwhelm
    it. The key attributes of the underlying style will be different with the addition
    of fruit and spice; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated
    version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and balance of the resulting
    combination. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles
    and fruits/spices work well together while others do not make for harmonious combinations.
    Whenever fruits, spices, herbs or vegetables are declared, each should be noticeable
    and distinctive in its own way (although not necessarily individually identifiable;
    balanced with the other ingredients is still critical) – in other words, the beer
    should read as a spiced fruit beer but without having to tell that specific fruits
    and spices are present (even if declared).
  flavor: As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the declared
    fruits and spices should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle
    to aggressive. The balance of fruit and spices with the underlying beer is vital,
    and the fruit character should not be so artificial and/or inappropriately overpowering
    as to suggest a spiced fruit juice drink. Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors,

    The sugar found in fruit is usually fully fermented and contributes to lighter
    flavors and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style.
    However, residual sweetness is not necessarily a negative characteristic unless
    it has a raw, unfermented quality. Some SHV(s) are inherently bitter and may result
    in a beer more bitter than the declared base style.

  category_notes: We use the common or culinary definitions of spices, herbs, and
    vegetables, not botanical or scientific ones. In general, spices are the dried
    seeds, seed pods, fruit, roots, bark, etc. of plants used for flavoring food.
    Herbs are leafy plants or parts of plants (leaves, flowers, petals, stalks) used
    for flavoring foods. Vegetables are savory or less sweet edible plant products,
    used primarily for cooking or sometimes eating raw. Vegetables can include some
    botanical fruit. This category explicitly includes all culinary spices, herbs,
    and vegetables, as well as nuts (anything with ‘nut' in the name, including coconut),
    chile peppers, coffee, chocolate, spruce tips, rose hips, hibiscus, fruit peels/zest
    (but not juice), rhubarb, and the like. It does not include culinary fruit or
    grains. Flavorful fermentable sugars and syrups (agave nectar, maple syrup, molasses,
    sorghum, treacle, honey, etc.) can be included only in combination with other
    allowable ingredients, and should not have a dominant character. Any combination
    of allowable ingredients may also be entered. See Category 29 for a definition
    and examples of fruit.

    and balanced with the distinctive SHV flavors present. Some SHV(s) are inherently
    bitter and may result in a beer more bitter than the declared base style.
  id: 30A
  impression: A harmonious marriage of SHV and beer, but still recognizable as a beer.
    The SHV character should be evident but in balance with the beer, not so forward
    as to suggest an artificial product.
  mouthfeel: Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate
    to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the base
    beer style being presented. Some SHV(s) may add additional body, although fermentable
    additions may thin out the beer. Some SHV(s) may add a bit of astringency, although
    a "raw" spice character is undesirable.

- appearance: Generally medium amber to coppery-brown (lighter versions are more common).
    Usually clear, although darker versions may be virtually opaque. Some chill haze
    is acceptable. Generally has a well-formed head that is often off-white to tan.
    Some versions with squashes will take on an unusual hue for beer, with orange-like
    hints.
  aroma: A wide range of aromatics is possible, although many examples are reminiscent
    of pumpkin pie, candied yams, or similar harvest or (US) Thanksgiving themed dishes.
    Any combination of aromatics that suggests the fall season is welcome. The base
    beer style often has a malty profile that supports the balanced presentation of
    the aromatics from spices and possibly other special ingredients. Additional fermentables
    (e.g., brown sugar, honey, molasses, maple syrup, etc.) may lend their own unique
    aromatics. Hop aromatics are often absent, subdued, or slightly spicy. Alcohol
    aromatics may be found in some examples, but this character should be restrained.
    The overall aroma should be balanced and harmonious, and is often fairly complex
    and inviting.

    vegetables, not botanical or scientific ones. In general, spices are the dried
    seeds, seed pods, fruit, roots, bark, etc. of plants used for flavoring food.
    Herbs are leafy plants or parts of plants (leaves, flowers, petals, stalks) used
    for flavoring foods. Vegetables are savory or less sweet edible plant products,
    used primarily for cooking or sometimes eating raw. Vegetables can include some
    botanical fruit. This category explicitly includes all culinary spices, herbs,

  comments: Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made Autumn Seasonal beer.
    The special ingredients should complement the base beer and not overwhelm it.
    The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and special
    ingredients work well together while others do not make for harmonious combinations.
    If the base beer is a classic style, the original style should come through in
    aroma and flavor. Whenever spices, herbs or additional fermentables are declared,
    each should be noticeable and distinctive in its own way (although not necessarily
    individually identifiable; balanced with the other ingredients is still critical)
    – in other words, the beer should read as a spiced beer but without having to
    tell that specific spices are present (even if declared).
  examples: Dogfish Head Punkin Ale, Schlafly Pumpkin Ale, Southampton Pumpkin Ale
  flavor: Many interpretations are possible; allow for brewer creativity as long as
    the resulting product is balanced and provides some spice (and optionally, sugar
    and vegetable) presentation. Spices associated with the fall season are typical
    (as mentioned in the Aroma section). The spices and optional fermentables should
    be supportive and blend well with the base beer style. Rich, malty and/or sweet
    malt-based flavors are common, and may include caramel, toasty, biscuity, or nutty
    flavors (toasted bread crust or cooked pie crust flavors are welcome). May include
    distinctive flavors from specific fermentables (molasses, honey, brown sugar,
    etc.), although these elements are not required. Flavor derived from squash-based
    vegetables are often elusive. The wide range of special ingredients should be
    supportive and balanced, not so prominent as to overshadow the base beer. Bitterness
    and hop flavor are generally restrained so as to not interfere with the spices
    and special ingredients. Generally finishes rather full and satisfying, and often
    has some alcohol flavor. Roasted malt characteristics are typically absent.
  id: 30B
  impression: An amber to copper, spiced beer that often has a moderately rich body
    and slightly warming finish suggesting a good accompaniment for the cool fall
    season, and often evocative of Thanksgiving traditions.
  ingredients: Spices are required, and often include those evocative of the fall
    or Thanksgiving season (e.g., allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger) but
    any combination is possible and creativity is encouraged. Flavorful adjuncts are
    often used (e.g., molasses, invert sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc.).
    Squash-type or gourd-type vegetables (most frequently pumpkin) are often used.
  mouthfeel: A wide range of interpretations is possible. Body is generally medium
    to full, and a certain malty and/or vegetable-based chewiness is often present.
    Moderately low to moderately high carbonation is typical. Many examples will show
    some well-aged, warming alcohol content, but without being overly hot. The beers
    do not have to be overly strong to show some warming effects.

    common). Usually clear, although darker versions may be virtually opaque. Some
    chill haze is acceptable. Generally has a well-formed head that is often off-white
    to tan.
  aroma: A wide range of aromatics is possible, although many examples are reminiscent

    or mulling spices. Any combination of aromatics that suggests the holiday season
    is welcome. The base beer style often has a malty profile that supports the balanced
    presentation of the aromatics from spices and possibly other special ingredients.
    Additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses, maple syrup, etc.) may lend their
    own unique aromatics. Hop aromatics are often absent, subdued, or slightly spicy.
    Some fruit character (often of dried citrus peel, or dried fruit such as raisins
    or plums) is optional but acceptable. Alcohol aromatics may be found in some examples,
    but this character should be restrained. The overall aroma should be balanced

    words, the beer should read as a spiced beer but without having to tell that specific
    spices are present (even if declared).
  examples: Anchor Our Special Ale, Goose Island Christmas Ale, Great Lakes Christmas
    Ale, Harpoon Winter Warmer, Lakefront Holiday Spice Lager Beer, Weyerbacher Winter
    Ale
  flavor: Many interpretations are possible; allow for brewer creativity as long as

    are rare, and not usually stronger than chocolate.
  history: Throughout history, beer of a somewhat higher alcohol content and richness
    has been enjoyed during the winter holidays, when old friends get together to
    enjoy the season. Many breweries produce unique seasonal offerings that may be
    darker, stronger, spiced, or otherwise more characterful than their normal beers.
    Spiced versions are an American or Belgian tradition, since English or German
    breweries traditionally do not use spices in their beer.
  id: 30C
  impression: A stronger, darker, spiced beer that often has a rich body and warming
    finish suggesting a good accompaniment for the cold winter season.
  ingredients: Generally ales, although some dark strong lagers exist. Spices are
    required, and often include those evocative of the Christmas season (e.g., allspice,
    nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger) but any combination is possible and creativity
    is encouraged. Fruit peel (e.g., oranges, lemon) may be used, as may subtle additions
    of other fruits. Flavorful adjuncts are often used (e.g., molasses, treacle, invert
    sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc.).

  aroma: Same as base beer style. The added grain will lend a particular character,
    although with some grains the beer will simply seem a bit more grainy or nutty.
    The alternative grain should provide the major aroma profile for this beer.

  category_notes: This category contains specialty beers that have some additional
    ingredient (grain or sugar) that adds a distinctive character.
  class: beer
  comments: If the alternative grain does not provide a noticeable distinguishable
    character to the beer, enter it as the base style. This style should not be used
    for styles where the alternative grain is fundamental to the style definition
    (e.g., Rye IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Rice- or Corn-based International Lager). Note
    that sake is not beer, and is not intended for this category.
  examples: Green's Indian Pale Ale, Lakefront New Grist, New Planet Pale Ale
  flavor: Same as base beer style. The additional grain should be noticeable in flavor,
    although it may not be necessarily identifiable. However, the alternative grain
    should provide the major flavor profile for this beer. Different grains have different
    characters; the additional grain should enhance the flavor of the base beer. Many
    will add an additional grainy, bready, or nutty flavor.

  impression: A base beer enhanced by or featuring the character of additional grain
    or grains. The specific character depends greatly on the character of the added

    ingredient (grain or sugar) that adds a distinctive character.
  class: beer
  comments: If the additional fermentables do not add a distinguishable character
    to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not
    have so much honey that it reads more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot)
    than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative
    sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored
    sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor
    or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.
  examples: Bell's Hopslam, Fullers Honey Dew, Lagunitas Brown Shugga'
  flavor: Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey,
    molasses, etc.) may add a flavor component. Whatever additional flavor component
    is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination.
    Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some added sugars will
    have unfermentable elements that may provide a fuller finish; fully fermentable
    sugars may thin out the finish.
  id: 31B
  impression: A harmonious marriage of sugar and beer, but still recognizable as a

- appearance: Variable. The appearance should reflect the base beer style, although
    the color of the beer is often a bit darker than the plain base style.
  aroma: The aroma should be a pleasant balance between the expected aroma of the
    base beer and the smokiness imparted by the use of smoked malts. The intensity
    and character of the smoke and base beer style can vary, with either being prominent
    in the balance. Smokiness may vary from low to assertive; however, balance in
    the overall presentation is the key to well-made examples. The quality and secondary
    characteristics of the smoke are reflective of the source of the smoke (e.g.,
    alder, oak, beechwood). Sharp, phenolic, harsh, rubbery, or burnt smoke-derived
    aromatics are inappropriate.
  category_id: '3'
  category_name: Smoked Beer
  category_notes: This category contains specialty beers that have a smoke character.
  class: beer
  comments: This style is for any beer that exhibits smoke as a principal flavor and
    aroma characteristic other than the Bamberg-style Rauchbier (i.e., beechwood-smoked
    Märzen), which has its own style. Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is
    to reach a pleasant balance between the smoke character and the base beer style.
    Entries should be judged on how well that style is represented, and how well it
    is balanced with the smoke character. Entries with a specific type or types of
    smoke cited will be judged on how well that type of smoke is recognizable and
    marries with the base style. Judges should evaluate the beers mostly on the overall
    balance, and how well the smoke character enhances the base beer.
  examples: Alaskan Smoked Porter, Schlenkerla Weizen Rauchbier and Ur-Bock Rauchbier,
    Spezial Lagerbier, Weissbier and Bockbier, Stone Smoked Porter
  flavor: As with aroma, there should be a balance between smokiness and the expected
    flavor characteristics of the base beer style. Smokiness may vary from low to
    assertive. Smoky flavors may range from woody to somewhat bacon-like depending
    on the type of malts used. The balance of underlying beer characteristics and
    smoke can vary, although the resulting blend should be somewhat balanced and enjoyable.
    Smoke can add some dryness to the finish. Harsh, bitter, burnt, charred, rubbery,
    sulfury, medicinal, or phenolic smoky characteristics are generally inappropriate
    (although some of these characteristics may be present in some base styles; however,
    the smoked malt shouldn't contribute these flavors).
  history: The process of using smoked malts has been adapted by craft brewers to
    many styles. German brewers have traditionally used smoked malts in bock, doppelbock,
    weissbier, dunkel, schwarzbier, helles, Pils, and other specialty styles.
  id: 32A
  impression: A smoke-enhanced beer showing good balance between the smoke and beer
    character, while remaining pleasant to drink. Balance in the use of smoke, hops
    and malt character is exhibited by the better examples.
  ingredients: Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and
    aroma characteristics. Beechwood, or other hardwood (oak, maple, mesquite, alder,
    pecan, apple, cherry, other fruitwoods) smoked malts may be used. The various
    woods may remind one of certain smoked products due to their food association
    (e.g., hickory with ribs, maple with bacon or sausage, and alder with salmon).
    Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal, piney flavor to
    the malt. Noticeable peat-smoked malt is universally undesirable due to its sharp,
    piercing phenolics and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining ingredients vary with
    the base style. If smoked malts are combined with other unusual ingredients (fruits,
    vegetables, spices, honey, etc.) in noticeable quantities, the resulting beer
    should be entered in the Specialty Smoked Beer.
  mouthfeel: Varies with the base beer style. Significant astringent, phenolic smoke-derived
    harshness is inappropriate.

  aroma: Varies with base style. A low to moderate wood- or oak-based aroma is usually
    present. Fresh wood can occasionally impart raw "green" aromatics, although this
    character should never be too strong. Other optional aromatics include a low to
    moderate vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, or cocoa character from any char on
    the wood. Any alcohol character should be smooth and balanced, not hot. Some background
    oxidation character is optional, and can take on a pleasant, sherry-like character
    and not be papery or cardboard-like. Should not have added alcohol character.
  category_id: '3'
  category_name: Wood Beer
  category_notes: This category contains specialty beers with a wood-aged character,
    with or without added alcohol character.
  class: beer
  comments: The base beer style should be apparent. The wood-based character should
    be evident, but not so dominant as to unbalance the beer. The intensity of the
    wood-based flavors is based on the contact time with the wood; the age, condition,
    and origin and char level of the barrel; and the type of wood. THIS CATEGORY SHOULD
    NOT BE USED FOR BASE STYLES WHERE WOOD-AGING IS A FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT FOR
    THE STYLE (e.g., Flanders Red, Lambic, etc.). Beers made using either limited
    wood aging or products that only provide a subtle background character may be
    entered in the base beer style categories as long as the wood character isn't
    prominently featured.
  examples: Bush Prestige, Cigar City Humidor India Pale Ale, Faust Holzfassgereifter
    Eisbock, Firestone Walker Double Barrel Ale, Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial
    Stout, Petrus Aged Pale, Samuel Smith Yorkshire Stingo
  flavor: Varies with base style. Wood usually contributes a woody or oaky flavor,
    which can occasionally take on a raw "green" flavor if new wood is used. Other
    flavors that may optionally be present include vanilla (from vanillin in the wood);
    caramel, butterscotch, toasted bread or almonds (from toasted wood); and coffee,
    chocolate, cocoa (from charred wood). The wood and/or other cask-derived flavors
    should be balanced, supportive and noticeable, but should not overpower the base
    beer style. Some background oxidation character is optional, although this should
    take on a pleasant, sherry-like character and not be papery or cardboard-like.
  history: A traditional production method that is rarely used by major breweries,
    and usually only with specialty products. More popular with modern American craft
    breweries looking for new, distinctive products. Oak cask and barrels are traditional,
    although other woods are becoming more popular.
  id: 33A
  impression: A harmonious blend of the base beer style with characteristics from
    aging in contact with wood. The best examples will be smooth, flavorful, well-balanced
    and well-aged.
  ingredients: Varies with base style. Aged in wooden casks or barrels, or using wood-based
    additives (wood chips, wood staves, oak essence). Fuller-bodied, higher-gravity
    base styles often are used since they can best stand up to the additional flavors,
    although experimentation is encouraged.
  mouthfeel: Varies with base style. Wood can add tannins to the beer, depending on
    age of the cask. The tannins can lead to additional astringency (which should
    never be high), or simply a fuller mouthfeel. Tart or acidic characteristics should
    be low to none, and never distracting.

    breweries looking for new, distinctive products. Oak cask and barrels are traditional,
    although other woods can be used.

  impression: A harmonious blend of the base beer style with characteristics from
    aging in contact with wood (including alcoholic products previously in contact
    with the wood). The best examples will be smooth, flavorful, well-balanced and
    well-aged.
  ingredients: Varies with base style. Aged in wooden casks or barrels previously
    used to store alcohol (e.g., whiskey, bourbon, port, sherry, Madeira, wine, etc).
    Fuller-bodied, higher-gravity base styles often are used since they can best stand
    up to the additional flavors, although experimentation is encouraged.
  mouthfeel: Varies with base style. Wood can add tannins to the beer, depending on
    age of the cask. The tannins can lead to additional astringency (which should
    never be high), or simply a fuller mouthfeel. Usually exhibits additional alcohol
    warming. Higher alcohol levels should not result in "hot" beers; aged, smooth
    flavors are most desirable. Tart or acidic characteristics should be low to none.

- appearance: Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may
    range from pale straw to deep golden amber (most are yellow to gold), depending
    on the variety of honey and blend of apples or ciders used.
  aroma: Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable
    honey and apple/cider character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have
    lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The apple/cider character should
    be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of apple-based character ranging
    from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal apple character (if declared) to
    a complex blend of apple aromatics. Some spicy or earthy notes may be present,
    as may a slightly sulfury character. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and
    can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower
    nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very
    noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have
    different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation
    character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter
    versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics
    from certain apple varieties are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character
    from malolactic fermentation (both are optional). Standard description applies

  category_name: Fruit Mead
  category_notes: A mead made with fruit is called a Melomel, although some melomels
    also have other names (cyser, pyment). We are introducing category names for certain
    types of melomels based on the variety of fruit used; these are more entry categories
    than actual styles. We selected different names for the category and subcategories
    to avoid the confusion of using the same names in different ways.See the Introduction
    to Mead Guidelines for detailed descriptions of standard mead characteristics,
    an explanation of standard terms, and entering instructions.Refer to Category
    M1 descriptions for additional detail on the character to be expected from dry,
    semi-sweet and sweet meads. Use those guidelines to judge distinctions between
    the various sweetness levels. Judging meads from dry to sweet is recommended as
    the primary ordering, with strength being the secondary ordering criterion.
  class: mead
  examples: Moonlight Blossom, White Winter Cyser, Rabbit's Foot Apple Cyser
  flavor: The apple and honey flavor intensity may vary from none to high; the residual
    sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet,
    depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength
    level has been declared (hydromel to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in apples
    may give some tartness and astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor
    and alcohol. Tannin levels may make a cyser seem drier than the residual sugar
    levels might suggest. A cyser may have a subtle to strong honey character, and
    may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is
    declared (different varieties have different intensities). Slight spicy phenolics
    from certain apple varieties are acceptable, as are a light diacetyl character
    from malolactic fermentation and a slight sulfur character (all are optional).
    Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.
  id: M2A
  impression: In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and
    well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead.
    Some of the best strong examples have the taste and aroma of an aged Calvados
    (apple brandy from northern France), while subtle, dry versions can taste similar
    to many fine white wines. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and
    honey character but not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness
    balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.
  mouthfeel: 'Standard description applies. Often wine-like. Some natural acidity
    is usually present (from the blend of apples) and helps balance the overall impression.
    Some apples can provide natural astringency, but this character should not be
    excessive. Ingredients: Standard description applies. Cyser is a mead made with
    the addition of apples or apple juice. Traditionally, cysers are made by the addition
    of honey to apple juice without additional water.'

    range from pale straw to deep purple-red, depending on the variety of grapes and
    honey used. The color should be characteristic of the variety or type of grape
    used, although white grape varieties may also take on color derived from the honey
    variety.
  aroma: Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable
    honey and grape/wine character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have
    lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The grape/wine character should
    be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of grape-based character ranging
    from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal grape character (if declared) to
    a complex blend of grape or wine aromatics. Some complex, spicy, grassy or earthy
    notes may be present (as in wine). The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can
    have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar.
    If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable
    varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different
    intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character,
    with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions
    will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from

    flavor and alcohol. A pyment may have a subtle to strong honey character, and
    may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is
    declared (different varieties have different intensities). Depending on the grape
    variety, some fruity, spicy, grassy, buttery, earthy, minerally, and/or floral
    flavors may be present. Some versions (particularly red pyments) may be oak-aged,
    with additional flavor complexity. Tannin levels may make the pyment seem drier
    than residual sugar levels might suggest. Standard description applies for remainder
    of characteristics.
  id: M2B
  impression: In well-made examples of the style, the grape is both distinctively
    vinous and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance
    of the mead. White and red versions can be quite different, and the overall impression
    should be characteristic of the type of grapes used and suggestive of a similar
    variety wine. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character
    but not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance
    is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.
  mouthfeel: 'Standard description applies. Wine-like. Some natural acidity is usually
    present (from grapes) and helps balance the overall impression. Grape tannin and/or
    grape skins can add body as well as some astringency, although this character
    should not be excessive. Use of oak can also add this character. Longer aging
    can smooth out tannin-based astringency. Ingredients: Standard description applies.
    A pyment is a mead made with the addition of grapes or grape juices. Alternatively,
    the pyment may be a homemade grape-based wine sweetened with honey, or a mead
    mixed with homemade grape-based wine after fermentation.'

    the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in mead is often
    lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different
    shades. Meads made with lighter color fruits can also take on color from varietal
    honeys. In meads that produce a head, the head can take on some of the fruit color
    as well.
  aroma: Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable
    honey and fruit character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower
    aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The fruit character should display
    distinctive aromatics associated with the particular fruit(s); however, note that
    some fruit (e.g., raspberries) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than
    others (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) — allow for a range of fruit character
    and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The fruit character should be pleasant
    and supportive, not artificial, raw, and/or inappropriately overpowering (considering
    the character of the fruit). In a blended berry mead, not all fruit may be individually
    identifiable or of equal intensity. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and
    can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower
    nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very
    noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have
    different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation
    character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter
    versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Some tartness may
    be present if naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be
    inappropriately intense. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.

- appearance: Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may
    take on a very wide range of colors, depending on the variety of fruit and/or
    honey used. For lighter-colored melomels with fruits that exhibit distinctive
    colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in mead is
    often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different
    shades. Meads made with lighter color fruits can also take on color from varietal
    honeys. In meads that produce a head, the head can take on some of the fruit color
    as well.
  aroma: Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable
    honey and fruit character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower
    aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The fruit character should display
    distinctive aromatics associated with the particular fruit(s); however, note that
    some fruit have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others — allow for
    a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The fruit
    character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial, raw (unfermented),
    and/or inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the fruit).
    In a blended fruit melomel, not all the fruits may be individually identifiable
    or of equal intensity. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light
    to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety
    of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal
    character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities
    and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with
    clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will
    have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Some tartness may be present if
    naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately
    intense. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.

  category_name: Fruit Mead
  category_notes: A mead made with fruit is called a Melomel, although some melomels
    also have other names (cyser, pyment). We are introducing category names for certain
    types of melomels based on the variety of fruit used; these are more entry categories
    than actual styles. We selected different names for the category and subcategories
    to avoid the confusion of using the same names in different ways.See the Introduction
    to Mead Guidelines for detailed descriptions of standard mead characteristics,
    an explanation of standard terms, and entering instructions.Refer to Category
    M1 descriptions for additional detail on the character to be expected from dry,
    semi-sweet and sweet meads. Use those guidelines to judge distinctions between
    the various sweetness levels. Judging meads from dry to sweet is recommended as
    the primary ordering, with strength being the secondary ordering criterion.
  class: mead
  comments: Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry
    and very sweet examples do exist.
  examples: Moonlight Desire, Paramour, and Iniquity
  flavor: The fruit and honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual
    sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet,
    depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength
    level has been declared (hydromel to sack). The natural acidity and tannin levels
    from fruit and fruit skins will vary, and this character is expected to be present
    in the mead, although in balance with sweetness, honey flavor, and alcohol. Tannin
    levels may make some meads seem drier than the residual sweetness might suggest.
    A melomel may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable
    to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties
    have different intensities). The distinctive flavor character associated with
    the particular fruit(s) should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from
    subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying mead is vital,
    and the fruit character should not be artificial, raw (unfermented), and/or inappropriately
    overpowering. In a melomel made with a combination of fruits, not all the fruits
    may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. Standard description applies
    for remainder of characteristics.

  subcategory_id: E
- appearance: Standard description applies, except perhaps to note that the color
    usually won't be affected by spices (although flowers, petals and peppers may
    provide subtle colors; tea blends may provide significant colors). The fruit may
    provide significant color, and is generally evocative of the fruit used (although
    it may be of a lighter shade than the fruit skin).
  aroma: Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable
    honey, fruit, and spice character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have
    lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The spice character should display
    distinctive aromatics associated with the particular spices; however, note that
    some spices (e.g., ginger, cinnamon) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive
    than others (e.g., chamomile, lavender) — allow for a range of spice character
    and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The spice character should be pleasant
    and supportive, not artificial and inappropriately overpowering (considering the
    character of the spice). The fruit character should display distinctive aromatics
    associated with the particular fruit; however, note that some fruits (e.g., raspberry,
    cherry) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., peach)
    — allow for a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive.
    The fruit character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial, raw (unfermented)
    and/or inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the fruit).
    In a mead with more than one fruit and/or spice, not all fruits and spices may
    be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. The honey aroma should be
    noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the
    aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have
    a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different
    varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show
    a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred.
    Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the
    nose. Some spices may produce spicy or peppery phenolics. Standard description
    applies for remainder of characteristics.

  class: mead
  comments: Often, a blend of fruits and spices may give a character greater than
    the sum of its parts. The better examples of this style often use spices judiciously;
    when more than one spice are used, they are carefully selected so that they blend
    harmoniously with the fruit and with each other.
  examples: Moonlight Kurt's Apple Pie, Mojo, Flame, Fling, and Deviant, Celestial
    Meads Scheherazade, Rabbit's Foot Private Reserve Pear Mead, Intermiel Rosée
  flavor: The spice flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the fruit flavor
    intensity may vary from subtle to high; the honey flavor intensity may vary from
    subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish
    may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared
    (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). The distinctive
    flavor character associated with the particular spices may range in intensity
    from subtle to aggressive (although some spices may not be individually recognizable,
    and can just serve to add a background complexity). Certain spices might add bitter,
    astringent, phenolic or spicy (hot) flavors; if present, these qualities should
    be related to the declared ingredients (otherwise, they are faults), and they
    should balance and blend with the honey, sweetness and alcohol. The distinctive
    flavor character associated with the particular fruits may range in intensity
    from subtle to aggressive (although some fruits may not be individually recognizable,

    one spice are used, they are carefully selected so that they blend harmoniously.
    A mead containing only culinary spices or herbs is known as a metheglin.

- appearance: Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics.
    Clarity may be good to brilliant, although many braggots are not as clear as other
    meads. A light to moderate head with some retention is expected if the mead is
    carbonated. Color may range from light straw to dark brown or black, depending
    on the variety of malt and honey used. The color should be characteristic of the
    declared beer style and/or honey used, if a variety is declared. Stronger versions
    may show signs of body (e.g., legs).
  aroma: Depending on the sweetness, strength and base style of beer, a subtle to
    distinctly identifiable honey and beer character (dry and/or hydromel versions
    will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The honey
    and beer/malt character should be complementary and balanced, although not always
    evenly balanced. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle
    to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties
    have different intensities and characters). If a base style of beer or type of
    malt is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable character reflective
    of the beer style (different styles and malts have different intensities and characters).
    A hop aroma (any variety or intensity) is optional; if present, it should blend
    harmoniously with the other elements. Standard description applies for remainder

  class: mead
  comments: Sometimes known as bracket or brackett. The fermentable sugars come from
    a balance of malt or malt extract and honey, although the specific balance is
    open to creative interpretation by brewers.
  examples: Rabbit's Foot Diabhal and Bière de Miele, Magic Hat Braggot, Brother Adams
    Braggot Barleywine Ale, White Winter Traditional Brackett
  flavor: Displays a balanced character identifiable as both a beer and a mead, although
    the relative intensity of flavors is greatly affected by the sweetness, strength,
    base style of beer, and variety of honey used. If a beer style is declared, the
    braggot should have some character traceable to the style although the flavors
    will be different due to the presence of honey. If a variety of honey is declared,
    the braggot should feature a subtle to prominent varietal character (different
    varieties have different intensities). Stronger and/or sweeter braggots should
    be expected to have a greater intensity of flavor than drier, lower gravity versions.
    The finish and aftertaste will vary based on the declared level of sweetness (dry
    to sweet), and may include both beer and mead components. A wide range of malt
    characteristics is allowable, from plain base malts to rich caramel and toast
    flavors to dark chocolate and roast flavors. Hop bitterness and flavor may be
    present, and may reflect any variety or intensity; however, this optional character
    should always be both suggestive of the base beer style and well blended with
    the other flavors. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.
  id: M4A
  impression: A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with the distinctive characteristics
    of both. A wide range of results are possible, depending on the base style of
    beer, variety of honey and overall sweetness and strength. Beer flavors tend to
    somewhat mask typical honey flavors found in other meads.
  mouthfeel: 'Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics.
    Smooth mouthfeel without astringency. Body may vary from moderately light to full,
    depending on sweetness, strength, and the base style of beer. Note that stronger
    meads will have a fuller body. A very thin or watery body is undesirable, as is
    a cloying, raw sweetness. A warming sense of well-aged alcohol may be present
    in stronger examples. Carbonation will vary as described in the standard description.
    A still braggot will usually have some level of carbonation (like a cask bitter)
    since a completely flat beer is unappetizing. However, just as an aged barleywine
    may be still, some braggots can be totally still. Ingredients: A braggot is a
    mead made with both honey and malt providing flavor and fermentable extract. Originally,
    and alternatively, a mixture of mead and ale. A braggot can be made with any type
    of honey, and any type of base beer style. The malt component may be derived from
    grain or malt extracts. The beer may be hopped or not. If any other ingredients
    than honey and beer are contained in the braggot, it should be entered as an Experimental
    Mead. Smoked braggots may be entered in this category if using smoked malt or
    a smoked beer as the base style; braggots made using other smoked ingredients
    (e.g., liquid smoke, chipotles) should be entered in the Experimental Mead style.'

  flavor: No overt apple character, but various flavors and esters that suggest apples,
    particularly tannic varieties. English-style ciders commonly go through MLF (see
    Introduction/Aroma-and-Flavor) which produces desirable spicy/smoky, phenolic,
    and farmyard/old-horse characters. These flavor notes are positive but not required.
    If present, they must not dominate; in particular, the phenolic and farmyard notes
    should not be heavy. A strong farmyard character without spicy/smoky or phenolic
    suggests a Brettanomyces contamination, which is a fault. Mousiness is a serious
    fault.

    Carbonation still to moderate. Bottle-fermented or -conditioned ciders may have
    high carbonation, up to champagne levels, but not gushing or foaming.

  category_notes: The styles represented in this category are the principal established
    styles. "New World" is simply a name change from the "Common" of earlier versions.There
    are known styles not represented here. In particular, Spanish (Asturian and Basque)
    does not yet have a style definition because there is presently insufficient appreciation
    and understanding, as well as a lack of commercial examples of known quality for
    reference. In the case of a cider made to a style not explicitly represented here,
    it should be entered in the closest applicable category. The first decision is
    whether the cider was made with apples with significant tannin content that gives
    the cider noticeable astringency or bitterness. If not, it should be entered as
    a New World Cider. If so, the choice is between the English and French sub-categories;
    this decision should be based on whether the cider tends more toward sweet, rich,
    somewhat fruity (French) or drier and more austere (English). For perry of a non-represented
    style, the decision is, as above, based on tannin content. If in doubt, enter
    as New World Perry.
  class: cider
  comments: Typically made sweet to balance the tannin levels from the traditional
    apple varieties.

  flavor: Fruity character/aroma. This may come from slow or arrested fermentation
    (in the French technique of défécation) or approximated by back-sweetening with
    juice. Tends to a rich fullness. MLF notes of spicy-smoky, phenolic, and farmyard
    are common but not required (just as with English style), and must not be pronounced.
    The French expect more subtle MLF character than do the English.
  id: C1C
  impression: Medium to sweet, full-bodied, rich.
  mouthfeel: Medium to full, mouth-filling. Moderate tannin, perceived mainly as astringency.
    Carbonation moderate to champagne-like, but at higher levels it must not gush
    or foam.

  comments: Some table pears may contain significant amounts of sorbitol, in which
    case a dry perry may give an impression of sweetness due to sorbitol in the pears.
    Perception of sorbitol as sweet is highly variable from one person to the next.
    Hence, entrants should specify sweetness according to actual residual sugar amount,
    and judges must be aware that they might perceive more sweetness than how the
    perry was entered.

    with the exception of added ingredients allowed.
  class: cider
  comments: Additives may include white and brown sugars, molasses, small amounts
    of honey, and raisins. Additives are intended to raise OG well above that which
    would be achieved by apples alone. This style is sometimes barrel-aged, in which
    case there will be oak character as with a barrel-aged wine. If the barrel was
    formerly used to age spirits, some flavor notes from the spirit (e.g., whisky
    or rum) may also be present, but must be subtle.

  flavor: The cider character must be present and must fit with the other fruits.
    It is a fault if the added fruit(s) completely dominate; a judge might ask, Would
    this be different if neutral spirits replaced the cider? A fruit cider should
    not be like an alco-pop. Oxidation is a fault.

  impression: Like a white wine with complex flavors. The apple character must marry
    with the added fruit so that neither one dominates the other.
